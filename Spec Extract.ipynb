IN-MOD.dot / Rév. 5 du 19.03.2010  IN-42.3-5.1 Std material spec Low alloyed steels for pressure vessels.doc  GENERAL COMMENTS    The information given hereafter for \"Base Metal Quality\" and \"Welding\" results from  AXENS/IFP wide and significant experience in the low alloyed steels made pressure vessels  specification/operation and mostly in the field of hydro-processing and reforming units.  Specific codes, as well as Client and Engineering Contractor Standards may also influence  the choice in materials and methods. Therefore, the given specifications shall be considered  as minimum requirements and should consequently be used by the Engineering Contractor  during call-for-bid.  The data given here, are defined in the aim at giving an appropriated quality and safety level  for these critical equipments. It should not in any case interfere with Contractor’s  specification relative to design, manufacturing and inspection of the equipment. In case of  any discrepancy between specifications, and for lack of any official derogating decision  issued by the Owner or the Contractor, then the more stringent requirement shall govern.      PREAMBLE:    The use of V-modified Cr-Mo steels is, for many years, considered as an enhancing  specification compared to corresponding conventional Cr-Mo steels.   Beyond the well-known improvement of design stress intensity resulting in thinner and lighter  reactors, they also offer an increased resistance to hydrogen damages, a lower susceptibility  to temper embrittlement and also a better resistance to weld overlay disbonding and creep  phenomena.  Fine, globular shape, stable and well distributed Vanadium carbides do favorably act in  providing excellent benefits to these steels.  Nevertheless, this steel grade should never be specified without considering its inherent  weakness in term of limited toughness and reduced weldability which require specific and  dedicated manufacturing and heat treatment procedures. Vendor should then be able to  establish its capability and its similar experience by demonstrating how dedicated  carefulness is applied all along fabrication steps.   Moreover, vendor shall typically assure a close cooperation with the steel supplier itself so as  to finally get the fine balance between the different specifications herein given.

REACTORS MANUFACTURING  2.1 Base Material Plates  The plates to be used for the fabrication of the equipment shall comply with the basic  requirements of the ASME Section II, Part A & D specification SA-542 Type D, Class 4a (or  SA-832 Gr 22 V for thickness < 150 mm) and SA-20 supplemented by following additional  requirements:     2.1.1 Steel making process/heat treatment  As generally specified for this kind of critical equipment, all plates should preferably be  ordered from steel made by the electric furnace and vacuum degassing process.  Nevertheless, basic oxygen furnace process with heated ladle refining and vacuum  degassing may also be considered as acceptable,  All plates shall be thermally treated either by annealing, normalizing-and-tempering, or, when  permitted by the purchaser, accelerated cooling from the austenitizing temperature by air  blasting or liquid quenching, followed by tempering,  Heat treatments holding time shall be sufficient to obtain an uniform temperature throughout  the plate,  The tempering temperature shall be adapted so as to give the required mechanical  properties after post-weld heat treatment. It shall consequently be noted that, depending on  cases, the Minimum temperature of Tempering may sometimes be higher than the one  defined for the final Post-Weld Heat Treatment of the equipment.    2.1.2 Chemical analysis  Applications for which V-modified grade is specified will typically be operated at high  temperature (i.e. above 350°C). As a consequence, potential metallurgical embrittling  phenomena shall be properly anticipated during design and manufacturing phases.  Countermeasures including specific chemical analysis given here-below shall consequently  be considered and that whatever the values specified by the construction codes.

IN-MOD.dot / Rév. 5 du 19.03.2010  IN-42.3-5.1 Std material spec Low alloyed steels for pressure vessels.doc  In view of minimizing the risk of temper embrittlement, the \"J\" factor shall verify the relation  hereafter :    J lower than 100 (target 80)  with J = (Si + Mn) * (P + Sn) * 104      All elements mentioned here above, specified in weight percentages, have to be checked on  ladle and on product.     Notes:   - Susceptibility to Temper Embrittlement phenomenon has forced steel producers to restrict  tramp elements contents, mainly P, Sb, Sn, As (in order of decreasing severity in weight  percent basis) which elements can detrimentally diffuse to the grain boundaries while steel is  held within the embrittling temperature range.   This criterion and also the specified impurities level shall uniformly be guarantied for the  whole vessel, including the shell, heads and all other plates made pressure retaining parts as  well (e.g. nozzle parts, elbows, etc.).    2.1.3 Mechanical properties  2.1.3.1 Test specimens  As per code requirements SA20 / SA370 unless otherwise specified by the project  For wall thicknesses above or equal to 50mm, location of the Test specimens shall be in  accordance with section 5.5.1.1 of API 934,  The impact tests shall be carried out after heat treatments simulating those anticipated along  the fabrication that is post-forming heat treatment and intermediate HT, if any, and also final  PWHT  The Mechanical tests shall be carried out after heat treatments simulating those anticipated  along the fabrication that is post-forming heat treatment, intermediate HT, if any, and final  PWHT plus additional heat treatments to anticipate potential repair (number to be defined by  Contractor/Owner).  All tensile, impact, temper embrittlement and hardness testing on heat affected zones (HAZ)  shall be carried out on samples from production weld test plates.

IN-MOD.dot / Rév. 5 du 19.03.2010  IN-42.3-5.1 Std material spec Low alloyed steels for pressure vessels.doc  2.1.3.2 Tensile properties  Tensile tests shall be carried out at room temperature for both ends of each plate (Tensile  tests at design temperature may be requested for information, depending on the Contractor  specification).  Room temperature tensile properties shall meet the requirements of the material standard.  Yield strength at design temperature shall meet the value taken into account in calculation  notes (Ultimate Tensile Strength will be given for information).  Note: For Creep range calculation, Yield and Ultimate Strength may be given for information  at the Owner/EPC discretion.    2.1.3.3 Impact test properties  Charpy V-Notch impact testing is required for all pressure retaining components, welds and  heat affected zones (HAZ).  The average of three impact test values at testing temperature shall not be less than 55J  (40ft.lb) without individual value below 47J (35ft.lb).  Testing temperature shall be the lower of the Minimum Design Metal Temperature (MDMT)  and -18°C (0°F).  Note: One shall note that sulfur does act on resilience properties and sulfur content shall  consequently be kept as low as possible to obtain high CVN energy.    2.1.3.4 Step cooling treatment  Axens uses to consider that the step cooling treatment should only be mandatory for  equipments for which the operating temperature is above 350°C which should typically be  the case for the present steel grade. Final decision to be given by Contractor/Owner  In the aim at assessing the Temper Embrittlement detrimental effect on plates, forgings and  welding, transition curves (Impact energy versus Temperature) has to be plotted before and  after step cooling test. Test specimen status definition, and step cooling procedure as well,  have to be submitted to Contractor/Owner approval.  Unless otherwise specified by client or detail engineering, the Step Cooling Treatment shall  be carried out on the thickest plate issued from the Heat showing the highest J factor.  The said Treatment will also be carried out on the thickest Plates issued from Heats showing  J factor higher than 80 or P + Sn > 0.012%, if any.  Each qualified welding procedure shall also be submitted to Step cooling test. Transition  curves shall be obtained for the deposited Welding Metal and Heat Affected Zones as well.  Note: Vendor may propose, based on its own experience, to reduce the number of test  coupons by focusing onto the welding procedures which are considered as being the more  detrimental ones regarding the expected embrittlement. Final decision remains at  Contractor/Owner discretion     STANDARD MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS   Réf.  Rév.

IN-MOD.dot / Rév. 5 du 19.03.2010  IN-42.3-5.1 Std material spec Low alloyed steels for pressure vessels.doc  For information only, a typical step cooling sequence could be:  Heat to 595°C Hold for 1 hour, cool at 6°C/h max. to 540°C  Heat to 540°C Hold for 15 hours, cool at 6°C/h max. to 525°C  Heat to 525°C Hold for 24 hours, cool at 6°C/h max. to 495°C  Heat to 495°C Hold for 60 hours, cool at 3°C/h max. to 470°C  Heat to 470°C Hold for 100 hours, cool at 28°C/h max. at 315°C and then air cooling    This simulated isothermal embrittlement results in a certain increase (shift) of the material’s  transition temperature. The increase in transition temperature (TT55) from its original value  has become an accepted tool for the determination of temper embrittlement susceptibility. In  order to characterize a material for temper embrittlement resistance, a relationship was  developed using the original or “as fabricated” TT55 and the increase in TT55 (delta TT55).  After step cooling heat treatment, for impact properties (Charpy-V at ¼ T and ½ T material  thickness) should meet the following requirements:    TT55 + 2.5 delta TT55 lower than or equal to 10°C    Where TT55 is the 55 Joules transition temperature   and delta TT55 is (TT55 [step cooled] - TT55 [original value])    Note: Major steel vendors use to propose step-cooling treatment surrendering, for base  material, based on their know-how and demonstrated experiences provided that the specified  impact test energy criterion is verified at temperature of -60°C or below while measured J  factor is below 100. It is assumed that the available extra-clean steels shall allow obtaining  such high resilience and CVN-Energy levels.   Even if final decision remain at the Owner/Contractor discretion for base material, one shall  note that all Welding Qualification must undergo dedicated Step Cooling test (CVN impact  energy obtained from product coupons will have to be in accordance with the one obtained  during Qualification phase).     2.1.3.5 Hardness properties  The material hardness shall not exceed 235 HB.    2.1.3.6 Responsibility for Base material Tests  Mechanical tests may be performed by the base materials Manufacturer or the reactor  Manufacturer. The Mechanical Tests shall allow ensuring that the minimum mechanical  properties required will be met after all anticipated heat treatments of the reactor during and  after fabrication.

F22V and the additional requirements given for plates as  defined in corresponding paragraph here before.  Forgings for which weight does not exceed 4540 kg (10000lb) may be supplied per ASME  Specification SA-182 Gr. F22V.

WELDING  3.1 General  The vessel Manufacturer shall not subcontract fabrication involving welding to others without  the written approval of the Contractor.  The plate, or forging edge preparation for welding as well as the nozzle openings will be  carried out by machining. Flame cutting may sometimes be allowed by the Contractor  provided the heat affected zone is completely removed by machining or grinding (ex: Nozzles  openings in shell or head).    3.2 Welding processes  - SAW : Submerged Arc Welding  The Manufacturer and brand name or grade of all welding consumables shall be  specified in the welding procedure and submitted to the Contractor for approval.  - SMAW : Shielded Manual Arc Welding  Only low hydrogen electrodes shall be used (refer to ASME II Part C SFA 5.5).  Dedicated procedure for electrodes drying/conditioning shall be submitted to Contractor  for approval.  - GTAW : Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (mainly for nozzles)  Remark:    - FCAW : Flux Cored Arc Welding may be considered as acceptable.  - GMAW : Gas Metal Arc Welding may be used for welds not subjected to pressure.    Notes:   - All the pressure retaining welds in hydrogen service , including the internals welded  on pressure parts, have to be full penetration type. If this is not possible, there will be a vent  drill-hole of the not welded area. External attachments are not concerned  - Only approved WPS with WPQR are to be used for fabrication. Welding procedures  submitted to the contractor shall include details variables and welding parameters for each  used welding process. Qualification test shall be made using filler metal, flux and / or inert  gases of same type, brand, chemistry and size as the ones to be used on work.  - Coupons to be used for Qualification test shall be heat treated in the same manner as  specified for the plate test as given in 2.1.3.

Note: Main alloying components such as Chromium, Molybdenum and Vanadium contents of  the weld deposits shall be within the range specified in ASME Section II, Part C for the  specified electrodes.    Material Certificates shall be delivered for each batch, lot, diameter of covered electrodes,  wire/flux combination to be used for fabrication.    Note: A procedure for flux conditioning so as to guarantee a potential diffusible hydrogen  content consistent with the recommendations of the welding consumables manufacturer shall  be submitted to contractor’s approval. As the same manner, the procedure for electrodes  conditioning shall also be submitted for approval.    Furthermore the high purity level of the steel shall be such that P, Sn, Sb and As be as low  as possible to meet BRUSCATO parameter in the weld deposit as follows:  X lower than 15ppm (target 12ppm)  with X= (10P+4Sn+5Sb+As)/100  (All chemical elements specified in ppm)    Note: Contractor may also require for some PMI (Positive Material Identification) to be  applied on deposited metal in the aim at checking the steel grade conformity.

CLADDING OR WELD OVERLAY  4.1 Cladding  High-Alloy clad materials shall be in accordance with the ASME Section II, Part A,  Specification SA-264 for Chromium-Nickel Steels.  Cladding shall be 3mm minimum thickness SA-240 or as specified on the drawings. A  140Mpa minimum shear strength per SA-264 is required. The clad plate shall be  ultrasonically examined in accordance with SA-578 supplementary requirements S7 using  Level 1 acceptance criteria.    4.2 Weld Overlay  Generally speaking (when clad is specified as SS 321 or SS 347, or overlay is specified as   SS 347, on data sheet), the weld overlay is applied using a two-layers technique as follows:  - First layer : 309L SS  - Second layer : 347 SS (type 321SS shall not be permitted)  - Minimum effective thickness of undiluted alloy (after final machining if any) shall be those  required on equipment data sheet specification.  However, single layer weld deposit overlay (type 309LNb as typical) may be used provided  the fabricator can demonstrate to the contractor the use of a qualified and acceptable  procedure.  Note 1: When clad is specified as SS 317L or overlay is specified as SS 317L on data sheet,  the weld overlay is applied using a two-layers technique as follow:  - First layer:  309LMo SS or 309L SS  - Second layer:  317L  (Single layer not allowed)  Note 2: The number of weld layers in production shall not be less than the number of layers  deposited for weld overlay procedure qualification tests.  When required by the Owner/User, a method to evaluate the weld overlay for susceptibility to  hydrogen disbonding shall be agreed to between the Fabricator and Owner/User. In such  case, the Owner/User shall define testing requirements and acceptance criteria. An example  of a standard disbonding test may be found in ASTM G 146.  Welding processes are the same than in  paragraph 3-2,  using strips or wires for SAW  process.  GMAW process is not allowed, except for structural attachments welding on overlay.  FCAW with gas shielding may also be used for some limited location such as overlay on Cr- Mo joint, internal support rings, etc.  Both of GMAW and FCAW processes shall be authorized by the Contractor. As the same  manner, the use of Electroslag (ESW) process remains subject to Contractor’s acceptance.  STANDARD MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS   Réf.  Rév.

Ferrite content is typically determined by the as-deposited chemical composition and the  WRC-diagram.    4.4 Nozzles and Manways  Nozzles and Manways (neck, flange, blind) in clad vessels, or in clad section of vessels, shall  be of the same base material as the vessel and internally clad, or overlaid, with the same  high alloy.  Loose lining, lap-joint flanges, welding of nozzle of different material than the vessel is not  permitted.

POST WELD HEAT TREATMENT  The equipment shall receive PWHT as required by ASME and/or applicable code cases.  Final PWHT modifies the microstructure of the weld metal and of the Heat Affected Zones. It  gives the best metallurgical asset of the weldment.  Unless otherwise specified by steel maker a typical recommended range of temperature  could be 690-720°C – Holding time by reactor manufacturer according to wall thickness and  code and taking into account the anticipated number of heat treatment cycles.  Note: Vessel Manufacturer has the full responsibility of the mechanical behavior of the  vessel. For this reason, PWHT specification shall be optimized and defined by himself (in  accordance with steel Manufacturer) so as to guaranty, at one and the same time,  mechanical and toughness characteristics on the delivered equipment.   Given typical temperature range may accordingly be reconsidered so as to get the fine  balance between strength and toughness..  Intermediate Heat treatments definition is under vessel vendor scope and shall be approved  by Contractor,  - ISR (intermediate stress relieving) uses to reduce the hydrogen content in the welds  and reduces residual stresses in the welded joints as well. The temperature for ISR is  typically led in between 650°C-680°C while holding time will depend on thickness  (min. 2h). Different holding temperature may be accepted when vessel manufacturer  has good fabrication experience. To be approved by Contractor. It is the standard  practice to require ISR for restrained welds such as nozzle attachment welds and  main welds that will not be immediately postweld heat treated.  - DHT (Dehydrogenation Treatment) only uses to reduce the hydrogen content in the  welds to prevent from hydrogen induced cracking. This alternative lower temperature  HT should be addressed on a case-by-case basis considering the low as-welded  toughness of V-modified steels and the induced risks. DHT shall not be allowed  without getting prior approval of the Contractor. This heat treatment is performed at  around 350°C (min.4h) ) thus limiting the Cr carbide precipitation in stainless steel  weld overlay if any. However, if vessel manufacturer has previous experience with  lower temperature and holding time he may propose other conditions supported by  data.  All welding (including potential weld repairs) will be completed before final PWHT excepted  where special care has been taken to avoid necessity of PWHT (buttering with high alloy  deposits).  Note: Local PWHT shall not be permitted.

For vessels designed and constructed in accordance with the rules of ASME Section VIII,  Div.2, non destructive examination (NDE) as a minimum shall comply with the Table AF- 241.1.    6.1 Minimum requirements  Minimum requirements for NDE should typically include the following non-destructive tests :  - Radiographic examination (RT) on all pressure welds (prior to PWHT only, provided  that UT is made before and after PWHT). RT is not so effective after PWHT for detecting  potential cracks. RT is sensitive for volumetric flaw such as slugs inclusion but not  sensitive for shape cracks which could appear during PWHT. Nevertheless, the final  decision, relative to RT examination sequences, belongs to the Contractor  - Use of the TOFD (Time Of Flight Diffraction) techniques in place of RT can be  proposed  by Vendor. Even if permitted by Code case, this shall be submitted to  Owner/Contractor approval  - Ultrasonic examination (UT) for all pressure welds (prior/after PWHT and after  hydrotest),  - Positive Material Identification (PMI) on all alloyed material if any (cladding, overlay,  etc.),  - Mill test report shall be supplied for all materials,  - Magnetic Particles Examination (MT) after PWHT,  - Dye penetrant examination (PT) of all weld overlay surfaces after PWHT.  Note: If Vendor can duly establish that weld-overlay has been performed continuously, thus  guarantying that no change in welding conditions has been encountered while depositing on  vessel shell, then PT could be performed on some representative w/o width lines only.  Procedure’s acceptance shall be submitted to Owner/Contractor decision. Whatever the  approved procedure will be, 100% complementary visual inspection always remains  mandatory.  - Hardness measurement.  - In case of cladding and/or overlay, Ferrite checking (magnetic ferriscope) in addition  to ferrite evaluation based upon sampling and chemical analysis. Acceptance criteria  of ferrite content by magnetic ferriscope shall be 3% to 10%. Magnetic instrument  shall be calibrated and certified per AWS A4-2.  STANDARD MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS   Réf.  Rév.

IN-MOD.dot / Rév. 5 du 19.03.2010  IN-42.3-5.1 Std material spec Low alloyed steels for pressure vessels.doc  GENERAL COMMENTS    The information given hereafter for \"Base Metal Quality\" and \"Welding\" results from  AXENS/IFP wide and significant experience in the low alloyed steels made pressure vessels  specification/operation and mostly in the field of hydro-processing and reforming units.  Specific codes, as well as Client and Engineering Contractor Standards may also influence  the choice in materials and methods. Therefore, the given specifications shall be considered  as minimum requirements and should consequently be used by the Engineering Contractor  during call-for-bid.  The data given here, are defined in the aim at giving an appropriated quality and safety level  for these critical equipments. It should not in any case interfere with Contractor’s  specification relative to design, manufacturing and inspection of the equipment. In case of  any discrepancy between specifications, and for lack of any official derogating decision  issued by the Owner or the Contractor, then the more stringent requirement shall govern.      PREAMBLE:    The use of V-modified Cr-Mo steels is, for many years, considered as an enhancing  specification compared to corresponding conventional Cr-Mo steels.   Beyond the well-known improvement of design stress intensity resulting in thinner and lighter  reactors, they also offer an increased resistance to hydrogen damages, a lower susceptibility  to temper embrittlement and also a better resistance to weld overlay disbonding and creep  phenomena.  Fine, globular shape, stable and well distributed Vanadium carbides do favorably act in  providing excellent benefits to these steels.  Nevertheless, this steel grade should never be specified without considering its inherent  weakness in term of limited toughness and reduced weldability which require specific and  dedicated manufacturing and heat treatment procedures. Vendor should then be able to  establish its capability and its similar experience by demonstrating how dedicated  carefulness is applied all along fabrication steps.   Moreover, vendor shall typically assure a close cooperation with the steel supplier itself so as  to finally get the fine balance between the different specifications herein given.

Nevertheless, basic oxygen furnace process with heated ladle refining and vacuum  degassing may also be considered as acceptable,  All plates shall be thermally treated either by annealing, normalizing-and-tempering, or, when  permitted by the purchaser, accelerated cooling from the austenitizing temperature by air  blasting or liquid quenching, followed by tempering,  Heat treatments holding time shall be sufficient to obtain an uniform temperature throughout  the plate,  The tempering temperature shall be adapted so as to give the required mechanical  properties after post-weld heat treatment. It shall consequently be noted that, depending on  cases, the Minimum temperature of Tempering may sometimes be higher than the one  defined for the final Post-Weld Heat Treatment of the equipment.    2.1.2 Chemical analysis  Applications for which V-modified grade is specified will typically be operated at high  temperature (i.e. above 350°C). As a consequence, potential metallurgical embrittling  phenomena shall be properly anticipated during design and manufacturing phases.  Countermeasures including specific chemical analysis given here-below shall consequently  be considered and that whatever the values specified by the construction codes.

Notes:   - Susceptibility to Temper Embrittlement phenomenon has forced steel producers to restrict  tramp elements contents, mainly P, Sb, Sn, As (in order of decreasing severity in weight  percent basis) which elements can detrimentally diffuse to the grain boundaries while steel is  held within the embrittling temperature range.   This criterion and also the specified impurities level shall uniformly be guarantied for the  whole vessel, including the shell, heads and all other plates made pressure retaining parts as  well (e.g. nozzle parts, elbows, etc.).    2.1.3 Mechanical properties  2.1.3.1 Test specimens  As per code requirements SA20 / SA370 unless otherwise specified by the project  For wall thicknesses above or equal to 50mm, location of the Test specimens shall be in  accordance with section 5.5.1.1 of API 934,  The impact tests shall be carried out after heat treatments simulating those anticipated along  the fabrication that is post-forming heat treatment and intermediate HT, if any, and also final  PWHT  The Mechanical tests shall be carried out after heat treatments simulating those anticipated  along the fabrication that is post-forming heat treatment, intermediate HT, if any, and final  PWHT plus additional heat treatments to anticipate potential repair (number to be defined by  Contractor/Owner).  All tensile, impact, temper embrittlement and hardness testing on heat affected zones (HAZ)  shall be carried out on samples from production weld test plates.

Room temperature tensile properties shall meet the requirements of the material standard.  Yield strength at design temperature shall meet the value taken into account in calculation  notes (Ultimate Tensile Strength will be given for information).  Note: For Creep range calculation, Yield and Ultimate Strength may be given for information  at the Owner/EPC discretion.    2.1.3.3 Impact test properties  Charpy V-Notch impact testing is required for all pressure retaining components, welds and  heat affected zones (HAZ).  The average of three impact test values at testing temperature shall not be less than 55J  (40ft.lb) without individual value below 47J (35ft.lb).  Testing temperature shall be the lower of the Minimum Design Metal Temperature (MDMT)  and -18°C (0°F).  Note: One shall note that sulfur does act on resilience properties and sulfur content shall  consequently be kept as low as possible to obtain high CVN energy.    2.1.3.4 Step cooling treatment  Axens uses to consider that the step cooling treatment should only be mandatory for  equipments for which the operating temperature is above 350°C which should typically be  the case for the present steel grade. Final decision to be given by Contractor/Owner  In the aim at assessing the Temper Embrittlement detrimental effect on plates, forgings and  welding, transition curves (Impact energy versus Temperature) has to be plotted before and  after step cooling test. Test specimen status definition, and step cooling procedure as well,  have to be submitted to Contractor/Owner approval.  Unless otherwise specified by client or detail engineering, the Step Cooling Treatment shall  be carried out on the thickest plate issued from the Heat showing the highest J factor.  The said Treatment will also be carried out on the thickest Plates issued from Heats showing  J factor higher than 80 or P + Sn > 0.012%, if any.  Each qualified welding procedure shall also be submitted to Step cooling test. Transition  curves shall be obtained for the deposited Welding Metal and Heat Affected Zones as well.  Note: Vendor may propose, based on its own experience, to reduce the number of test  coupons by focusing onto the welding procedures which are considered as being the more  detrimental ones regarding the expected embrittlement.

The increase in transition temperature (TT55) from its original value  has become an accepted tool for the determination of temper embrittlement susceptibility. In  order to characterize a material for temper embrittlement resistance, a relationship was  developed using the original or “as fabricated” TT55 and the increase in TT55 (delta TT55).  After step cooling heat treatment, for impact properties (Charpy-V at ¼ T and ½ T material  thickness) should meet the following requirements:    TT55 + 2.5 delta TT55 lower than or equal to 10°C    Where TT55 is the 55 Joules transition temperature   and delta TT55 is (TT55 [step cooled] - TT55 [original value])    Note: Major steel vendors use to propose step-cooling treatment surrendering, for base  material, based on their know-how and demonstrated experiences provided that the specified  impact test energy criterion is verified at temperature of -60°C or below while measured J  factor is below 100. It is assumed that the available extra-clean steels shall allow obtaining  such high resilience and CVN-Energy levels.   Even if final decision remain at the Owner/Contractor discretion for base material, one shall  note that all Welding Qualification must undergo dedicated Step Cooling test (CVN impact  energy obtained from product coupons will have to be in accordance with the one obtained  during Qualification phase).     2.1.3.5 Hardness properties  The material hardness shall not exceed 235 HB.    2.1.3.6 Responsibility for Base material Tests  Mechanical tests may be performed by the base materials Manufacturer or the reactor  Manufacturer.

Notes:   - All the pressure retaining welds in hydrogen service , including the internals welded  on pressure parts, have to be full penetration type. If this is not possible, there will be a vent  drill-hole of the not welded area. External attachments are not concerned  - Only approved WPS with WPQR are to be used for fabrication. Welding procedures  submitted to the contractor shall include details variables and welding parameters for each  used welding process. Qualification test shall be made using filler metal, flux and / or inert  gases of same type, brand, chemistry and size as the ones to be used on work.  - Coupons to be used for Qualification test shall be heat treated in the same manner as  specified for the plate test as given in 2.1.3.

Cladding shall be 3mm minimum thickness SA-240 or as specified on the drawings. A  140Mpa minimum shear strength per SA-264 is required. The clad plate shall be  ultrasonically examined in accordance with SA-578 supplementary requirements S7 using  Level 1 acceptance criteria.    4.2 Weld Overlay  Generally speaking (when clad is specified as SS 321 or SS 347, or overlay is specified as   SS 347, on data sheet), the weld overlay is applied using a two-layers technique as follows:  - First layer : 309L SS  - Second layer : 347 SS (type 321SS shall not be permitted)  - Minimum effective thickness of undiluted alloy (after final machining if any) shall be those  required on equipment data sheet specification.  However, single layer weld deposit overlay (type 309LNb as typical) may be used provided  the fabricator can demonstrate to the contractor the use of a qualified and acceptable  procedure.  Note 1: When clad is specified as SS 317L or overlay is specified as SS 317L on data sheet,  the weld overlay is applied using a two-layers technique as follow:  - First layer:  309LMo SS or 309L SS  - Second layer:  317L  (Single layer not allowed)  Note 2: The number of weld layers in production shall not be less than the number of layers  deposited for weld overlay procedure qualification tests.  When required by the Owner/User, a method to evaluate the weld overlay for susceptibility to  hydrogen disbonding shall be agreed to between the Fabricator and Owner/User. In such  case, the Owner/User shall define testing requirements and acceptance criteria. An example  of a standard disbonding test may be found in ASTM G 146.  Welding processes are the same than in  paragraph 3-2,  using strips or wires for SAW  process.  GMAW process is not allowed, except for structural attachments welding on overlay.  FCAW with gas shielding may also be used for some limited location such as overlay on Cr- Mo joint, internal support rings, etc.  Both of GMAW and FCAW processes shall be authorized by the Contractor. As the same  manner, the use of Electroslag (ESW) process remains subject to Contractor’s acceptance.  STANDARD MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS   Réf.  Rév.

POST WELD HEAT TREATMENT  The equipment shall receive PWHT as required by ASME and/or applicable code cases.  Final PWHT modifies the microstructure of the weld metal and of the Heat Affected Zones. It  gives the best metallurgical asset of the weldment.  Unless otherwise specified by steel maker a typical recommended range of temperature  could be 690-720°C – Holding time by reactor manufacturer according to wall thickness and  code and taking into account the anticipated number of heat treatment cycles.  Note: Vessel Manufacturer has the full responsibility of the mechanical behavior of the  vessel. For this reason, PWHT specification shall be optimized and defined by himself (in  accordance with steel Manufacturer) so as to guaranty, at one and the same time,  mechanical and toughness characteristics on the delivered equipment.   Given typical temperature range may accordingly be reconsidered so as to get the fine  balance between strength and toughness..  Intermediate Heat treatments definition is under vessel vendor scope and shall be approved  by Contractor,  - ISR (intermediate stress relieving) uses to reduce the hydrogen content in the welds  and reduces residual stresses in the welded joints as well. The temperature for ISR is  typically led in between 650°C-680°C while holding time will depend on thickness  (min. 2h). Different holding temperature may be accepted when vessel manufacturer  has good fabrication experience. To be approved by Contractor. It is the standard  practice to require ISR for restrained welds such as nozzle attachment welds and  main welds that will not be immediately postweld heat treated.  - DHT (Dehydrogenation Treatment) only uses to reduce the hydrogen content in the  welds to prevent from hydrogen induced cracking. This alternative lower temperature  HT should be addressed on a case-by-case basis considering the low as-welded  toughness of V-modified steels and the induced risks. DHT shall not be allowed  without getting prior approval of the Contractor. This heat treatment is performed at  around 350°C (min.4h) ) thus limiting the Cr carbide precipitation in stainless steel  weld overlay if any. However, if vessel manufacturer has previous experience with  lower temperature and holding time he may propose other conditions supported by  data.  All welding (including potential weld repairs) will be completed before final PWHT excepted  where special care has been taken to avoid necessity of PWHT (buttering with high alloy  deposits).  Note: Local PWHT shall not be permitted. In case of any furnace size limitation, vessel  Manufacturer shall obtain specific derogation from the Contractor to perform local PWHT at  the closing seam of shell.

NON DESTRUCTIVE TESTING BY FABRICATOR  For vessels designed and constructed in accordance with the rules of ASME Section VIII,  Div.1, Inspection Plan and Testing Plan shall be submitted to Engineering (EPC) for  approval.  For vessels designed and constructed in accordance with the rules of ASME Section VIII,  Div.2, non destructive examination (NDE) as a minimum shall comply with the Table AF- 241.1.    6.1 Minimum requirements  Minimum requirements for NDE should typically include the following non-destructive tests :  - Radiographic examination (RT) on all pressure welds (prior to PWHT only, provided  that UT is made before and after PWHT). RT is not so effective after PWHT for detecting  potential cracks. RT is sensitive for volumetric flaw such as slugs inclusion but not  sensitive for shape cracks which could appear during PWHT. Nevertheless, the final  decision, relative to RT examination sequences, belongs to the Contractor  - Use of the TOFD (Time Of Flight Diffraction) techniques in place of RT can be  proposed  by Vendor. Even if permitted by Code case, this shall be submitted to  Owner/Contractor approval  - Ultrasonic examination (UT) for all pressure welds (prior/after PWHT and after  hydrotest),  - Positive Material Identification (PMI) on all alloyed material if any (cladding, overlay,  etc.),  - Mill test report shall be supplied for all materials,  - Magnetic Particles Examination (MT) after PWHT,  - Dye penetrant examination (PT) of all weld overlay surfaces after PWHT.  Note: If Vendor can duly establish that weld-overlay has been performed continuously, thus  guarantying that no change in welding conditions has been encountered while depositing on  vessel shell, then PT could be performed on some representative w/o width lines only.  Procedure’s acceptance shall be submitted to Owner/Contractor decision. Whatever the  approved procedure will be, 100% complementary visual inspection always remains  mandatory.  - Hardness measurement.  - In case of cladding and/or overlay, Ferrite checking (magnetic ferriscope) in addition  to ferrite evaluation based upon sampling and chemical analysis. Acceptance criteria  of ferrite content by magnetic ferriscope shall be 3% to 10%. Magnetic instrument  shall be calibrated and certified per AWS A4-2.  STANDARD MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS   Réf.  Rév.

IN-MOD.dot / Rév. 5 du 19.03.2010  IN-42.3-5.1 Std material spec Low alloyed steels for pressure vessels.doc  GENERAL COMMENTS    The information given hereafter for \"Base Metal Quality\" and \"Welding\" results from  AXENS/IFP wide and significant experience in the low alloyed steels made pressure vessels  specification/operation and mostly in the field of hydro-processing and reforming units.  Specific codes, as well as Client and Engineering Contractor Standards may also influence  the choice in materials and methods. Therefore, the given specifications shall be considered  as minimum requirements and should consequently be used by the Engineering Contractor  during call-for-bid.  The data given here, are defined in the aim at giving an appropriated quality and safety level  for these critical equipments. It should not in any case interfere with Contractor’s  specification relative to design, manufacturing and inspection of the equipment. In case of  any discrepancy between specifications, and for lack of any official derogating decision  issued by the Owner or the Contractor, then the more stringent requirement shall govern.      PREAMBLE:    The use of V-modified Cr-Mo steels is, for many years, considered as an enhancing  specification compared to corresponding conventional Cr-Mo steels.   Beyond the well-known improvement of design stress intensity resulting in thinner and lighter  reactors, they also offer an increased resistance to hydrogen damages, a lower susceptibility  to temper embrittlement and also a better resistance to weld overlay disbonding and creep  phenomena.  Fine, globular shape, stable and well distributed Vanadium carbides do favorably act in  providing excellent benefits to these steels.  Nevertheless, this steel grade should never be specified without considering its inherent  weakness in term of limited toughness and reduced weldability which require specific and  dedicated manufacturing and heat treatment procedures. Vendor should then be able to  establish its capability and its similar experience by demonstrating how dedicated  carefulness is applied all along fabrication steps.   Moreover, vendor shall typically assure a close cooperation with the steel supplier itself so as  to finally get the fine balance between the different specifications herein given.

Nevertheless, basic oxygen furnace process with heated ladle refining and vacuum  degassing may also be considered as acceptable,  All plates shall be thermally treated either by annealing, normalizing-and-tempering, or, when  permitted by the purchaser, accelerated cooling from the austenitizing temperature by air  blasting or liquid quenching, followed by tempering,  Heat treatments holding time shall be sufficient to obtain an uniform temperature throughout  the plate,  The tempering temperature shall be adapted so as to give the required mechanical  properties after post-weld heat treatment. It shall consequently be noted that, depending on  cases, the Minimum temperature of Tempering may sometimes be higher than the one  defined for the final Post-Weld Heat Treatment of the equipment.    2.1.2 Chemical analysis  Applications for which V-modified grade is specified will typically be operated at high  temperature (i.e. above 350°C). As a consequence, potential metallurgical embrittling  phenomena shall be properly anticipated during design and manufacturing phases.  Countermeasures including specific chemical analysis given here-below shall consequently  be considered and that whatever the values specified by the construction codes.

Notes:   - Susceptibility to Temper Embrittlement phenomenon has forced steel producers to restrict  tramp elements contents, mainly P, Sb, Sn, As (in order of decreasing severity in weight  percent basis) which elements can detrimentally diffuse to the grain boundaries while steel is  held within the embrittling temperature range.   This criterion and also the specified impurities level shall uniformly be guarantied for the  whole vessel, including the shell, heads and all other plates made pressure retaining parts as  well (e.g. nozzle parts, elbows, etc.).    2.1.3 Mechanical properties  2.1.3.1 Test specimens  As per code requirements SA20 / SA370 unless otherwise specified by the project  For wall thicknesses above or equal to 50mm, location of the Test specimens shall be in  accordance with section 5.5.1.1 of API 934,  The impact tests shall be carried out after heat treatments simulating those anticipated along  the fabrication that is post-forming heat treatment and intermediate HT, if any, and also final  PWHT  The Mechanical tests shall be carried out after heat treatments simulating those anticipated  along the fabrication that is post-forming heat treatment, intermediate HT, if any, and final  PWHT plus additional heat treatments to anticipate potential repair (number to be defined by  Contractor/Owner).

Room temperature tensile properties shall meet the requirements of the material standard.  Yield strength at design temperature shall meet the value taken into account in calculation  notes (Ultimate Tensile Strength will be given for information).  Note: For Creep range calculation, Yield and Ultimate Strength may be given for information  at the Owner/EPC discretion.    2.1.3.3 Impact test properties  Charpy V-Notch impact testing is required for all pressure retaining components, welds and  heat affected zones (HAZ).  The average of three impact test values at testing temperature shall not be less than 55J  (40ft.lb) without individual value below 47J (35ft.lb).  Testing temperature shall be the lower of the Minimum Design Metal Temperature (MDMT)  and -18°C (0°F).  Note: One shall note that sulfur does act on resilience properties and sulfur content shall  consequently be kept as low as possible to obtain high CVN energy.    2.1.3.4 Step cooling treatment  Axens uses to consider that the step cooling treatment should only be mandatory for  equipments for which the operating temperature is above 350°C which should typically be  the case for the present steel grade. Final decision to be given by Contractor/Owner  In the aim at assessing the Temper Embrittlement detrimental effect on plates, forgings and  welding, transition curves (Impact energy versus Temperature) has to be plotted before and  after step cooling test. Test specimen status definition, and step cooling procedure as well,  have to be submitted to Contractor/Owner approval.  Unless otherwise specified by client or detail engineering, the Step Cooling Treatment shall  be carried out on the thickest plate issued from the Heat showing the highest J factor.  The said Treatment will also be carried out on the thickest Plates issued from Heats showing  J factor higher than 80 or P + Sn > 0.012%, if any.  Each qualified welding procedure shall also be submitted to Step cooling test. Transition  curves shall be obtained for the deposited Welding Metal and Heat Affected Zones as well.  Note: Vendor may propose, based on its own experience, to reduce the number of test  coupons by focusing onto the welding procedures which are considered as being the more  detrimental ones regarding the expected embrittlement.

The increase in transition temperature (TT55) from its original value  has become an accepted tool for the determination of temper embrittlement susceptibility. In  order to characterize a material for temper embrittlement resistance, a relationship was  developed using the original or “as fabricated” TT55 and the increase in TT55 (delta TT55).  After step cooling heat treatment, for impact properties (Charpy-V at ¼ T and ½ T material  thickness) should meet the following requirements:    TT55 + 2.5 delta TT55 lower than or equal to 10°C    Where TT55 is the 55 Joules transition temperature   and delta TT55 is (TT55 [step cooled] - TT55 [original value])    Note: Major steel vendors use to propose step-cooling treatment surrendering, for base  material, based on their know-how and demonstrated experiences provided that the specified  impact test energy criterion is verified at temperature of -60°C or below while measured J  factor is below 100. It is assumed that the available extra-clean steels shall allow obtaining  such high resilience and CVN-Energy levels.   Even if final decision remain at the Owner/Contractor discretion for base material, one shall  note that all Welding Qualification must undergo dedicated Step Cooling test (CVN impact  energy obtained from product coupons will have to be in accordance with the one obtained  during Qualification phase).     2.1.3.5 Hardness properties  The material hardness shall not exceed 235 HB.    2.1.3.6 Responsibility for Base material Tests  Mechanical tests may be performed by the base materials Manufacturer or the reactor  Manufacturer.

CLADDING OR WELD OVERLAY  4.1 Cladding  High-Alloy clad materials shall be in accordance with the ASME Section II, Part A,  Specification SA-264 for Chromium-Nickel Steels.  Cladding shall be 3mm minimum thickness SA-240 or as specified on the drawings. A  140Mpa minimum shear strength per SA-264 is required. The clad plate shall be  ultrasonically examined in accordance with SA-578 supplementary requirements S7 using  Level 1 acceptance criteria.    4.2 Weld Overlay  Generally speaking (when clad is specified as SS 321 or SS 347, or overlay is specified as   SS 347, on data sheet), the weld overlay is applied using a two-layers technique as follows:  - First layer : 309L SS  - Second layer : 347 SS (type 321SS shall not be permitted)  - Minimum effective thickness of undiluted alloy (after final machining if any) shall be those  required on equipment data sheet specification.  However, single layer weld deposit overlay (type 309LNb as typical) may be used provided  the fabricator can demonstrate to the contractor the use of a qualified and acceptable  procedure.  Note 1: When clad is specified as SS 317L or overlay is specified as SS 317L on data sheet,  the weld overlay is applied using a two-layers technique as follow:  - First layer:  309LMo SS or 309L SS  - Second layer:  317L  (Single layer not allowed)  Note 2: The number of weld layers in production shall not be less than the number of layers  deposited for weld overlay procedure qualification tests.  When required by the Owner/User, a method to evaluate the weld overlay for susceptibility to  hydrogen disbonding shall be agreed to between the Fabricator and Owner/User. In such  case, the Owner/User shall define testing requirements and acceptance criteria. An example  of a standard disbonding test may be found in ASTM G 146.  Welding processes are the same than in  paragraph 3-2,  using strips or wires for SAW  process.  GMAW process is not allowed, except for structural attachments welding on overlay.  FCAW with gas shielding may also be used for some limited location such as overlay on Cr- Mo joint, internal support rings, etc.  Both of GMAW and FCAW processes shall be authorized by the Contractor. As the same  manner, the use of Electroslag (ESW) process remains subject to Contractor’s acceptance.  STANDARD MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS   Réf.  Rév.

POST WELD HEAT TREATMENT  The equipment shall receive PWHT as required by ASME and/or applicable code cases.  Final PWHT modifies the microstructure of the weld metal and of the Heat Affected Zones. It  gives the best metallurgical asset of the weldment.  Unless otherwise specified by steel maker a typical recommended range of temperature  could be 690-720°C – Holding time by reactor manufacturer according to wall thickness and  code and taking into account the anticipated number of heat treatment cycles.  Note: Vessel Manufacturer has the full responsibility of the mechanical behavior of the  vessel. For this reason, PWHT specification shall be optimized and defined by himself (in  accordance with steel Manufacturer) so as to guaranty, at one and the same time,  mechanical and toughness characteristics on the delivered equipment.   Given typical temperature range may accordingly be reconsidered so as to get the fine  balance between strength and toughness..  Intermediate Heat treatments definition is under vessel vendor scope and shall be approved  by Contractor,  - ISR (intermediate stress relieving) uses to reduce the hydrogen content in the welds  and reduces residual stresses in the welded joints as well. The temperature for ISR is  typically led in between 650°C-680°C while holding time will depend on thickness  (min. 2h). Different holding temperature may be accepted when vessel manufacturer  has good fabrication experience. To be approved by Contractor. It is the standard  practice to require ISR for restrained welds such as nozzle attachment welds and  main welds that will not be immediately postweld heat treated.  - DHT (Dehydrogenation Treatment) only uses to reduce the hydrogen content in the  welds to prevent from hydrogen induced cracking. This alternative lower temperature  HT should be addressed on a case-by-case basis considering the low as-welded  toughness of V-modified steels and the induced risks. DHT shall not be allowed  without getting prior approval of the Contractor. This heat treatment is performed at  around 350°C (min.4h) ) thus limiting the Cr carbide precipitation in stainless steel  weld overlay if any. However, if vessel manufacturer has previous experience with  lower temperature and holding time he may propose other conditions supported by  data.  All welding (including potential weld repairs) will be completed before final PWHT excepted  where special care has been taken to avoid necessity of PWHT (buttering with high alloy  deposits).  Note: Local PWHT shall not be permitted. In case of any furnace size limitation, vessel  Manufacturer shall obtain specific derogation from the Contractor to perform local PWHT at  the closing seam of shell.

NON DESTRUCTIVE TESTING BY FABRICATOR  For vessels designed and constructed in accordance with the rules of ASME Section VIII,  Div.1, Inspection Plan and Testing Plan shall be submitted to Engineering (EPC) for  approval.  For vessels designed and constructed in accordance with the rules of ASME Section VIII,  Div.2, non destructive examination (NDE) as a minimum shall comply with the Table AF- 241.1.    6.1 Minimum requirements  Minimum requirements for NDE should typically include the following non-destructive tests :  - Radiographic examination (RT) on all pressure welds (prior to PWHT only, provided  that UT is made before and after PWHT). RT is not so effective after PWHT for detecting  potential cracks. RT is sensitive for volumetric flaw such as slugs inclusion but not  sensitive for shape cracks which could appear during PWHT. Nevertheless, the final  decision, relative to RT examination sequences, belongs to the Contractor  - Use of the TOFD (Time Of Flight Diffraction) techniques in place of RT can be  proposed  by Vendor. Even if permitted by Code case, this shall be submitted to  Owner/Contractor approval  - Ultrasonic examination (UT) for all pressure welds (prior/after PWHT and after  hydrotest),  - Positive Material Identification (PMI) on all alloyed material if any (cladding, overlay,  etc.),  - Mill test report shall be supplied for all materials,  - Magnetic Particles Examination (MT) after PWHT,  - Dye penetrant examination (PT) of all weld overlay surfaces after PWHT.  Note: If Vendor can duly establish that weld-overlay has been performed continuously, thus  guarantying that no change in welding conditions has been encountered while depositing on  vessel shell, then PT could be performed on some representative w/o width lines only.  Procedure’s acceptance shall be submitted to Owner/Contractor decision. Whatever the  approved procedure will be, 100% complementary visual inspection always remains  mandatory.  - Hardness measurement.  - In case of cladding and/or overlay, Ferrite checking (magnetic ferriscope) in addition  to ferrite evaluation based upon sampling and chemical analysis. Acceptance criteria  of ferrite content by magnetic ferriscope shall be 3% to 10%. Magnetic instrument  shall be calibrated and certified per AWS A4-2.  STANDARD MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS   Réf.  Rév.

IN-MOD.dot / Rév. 5 du 19.03.2010  IN-42.3-5.1 Std material spec Low alloyed steels for pressure vessels.doc  GENERAL COMMENTS    The information given hereafter for \"Base Metal Quality\" and \"Welding\" results from  AXENS/IFP wide and significant experience in the low alloyed steels made pressure vessels  specification/operation and mostly in the field of hydro-processing and reforming units.  Specific codes, as well as Client and Engineering Contractor Standards may also influence  the choice in materials and methods. Therefore, the given specifications shall be considered  as minimum requirements and should consequently be used by the Engineering Contractor  during call-for-bid.  The data given here, are defined in the aim at giving an appropriated quality and safety level  for these critical equipments. It should not in any case interfere with Contractor’s  specification relative to design, manufacturing and inspection of the equipment. In case of  any discrepancy between specifications, and for lack of any official derogating decision  issued by the Owner or the Contractor, then the more stringent requirement shall govern.      PREAMBLE:    The use of V-modified Cr-Mo steels is, for many years, considered as an enhancing  specification compared to corresponding conventional Cr-Mo steels.   Beyond the well-known improvement of design stress intensity resulting in thinner and lighter  reactors, they also offer an increased resistance to hydrogen damages, a lower susceptibility  to temper embrittlement and also a better resistance to weld overlay disbonding and creep  phenomena.  Fine, globular shape, stable and well distributed Vanadium carbides do favorably act in  providing excellent benefits to these steels.  Nevertheless, this steel grade should never be specified without considering its inherent  weakness in term of limited toughness and reduced weldability which require specific and  dedicated manufacturing and heat treatment procedures. Vendor should then be able to  establish its capability and its similar experience by demonstrating how dedicated  carefulness is applied all along fabrication steps.   Moreover, vendor shall typically assure a close cooperation with the steel supplier itself so as  to finally get the fine balance between the different specifications herein given.

Nevertheless, basic oxygen furnace process with heated ladle refining and vacuum  degassing may also be considered as acceptable,  All plates shall be thermally treated either by annealing, normalizing-and-tempering, or, when  permitted by the purchaser, accelerated cooling from the austenitizing temperature by air  blasting or liquid quenching, followed by tempering,  Heat treatments holding time shall be sufficient to obtain an uniform temperature throughout  the plate,  The tempering temperature shall be adapted so as to give the required mechanical  properties after post-weld heat treatment. It shall consequently be noted that, depending on  cases, the Minimum temperature of Tempering may sometimes be higher than the one  defined for the final Post-Weld Heat Treatment of the equipment.    2.1.2 Chemical analysis  Applications for which V-modified grade is specified will typically be operated at high  temperature (i.e. above 350°C). As a consequence, potential metallurgical embrittling  phenomena shall be properly anticipated during design and manufacturing phases.

Yield strength at design temperature shall meet the value taken into account in calculation  notes (Ultimate Tensile Strength will be given for information).  Note: For Creep range calculation, Yield and Ultimate Strength may be given for information  at the Owner/EPC discretion.    2.1.3.3 Impact test properties  Charpy V-Notch impact testing is required for all pressure retaining components, welds and  heat affected zones (HAZ).  The average of three impact test values at testing temperature shall not be less than 55J  (40ft.lb) without individual value below 47J (35ft.lb).

Note: One shall note that sulfur does act on resilience properties and sulfur content shall  consequently be kept as low as possible to obtain high CVN energy.    2.1.3.4 Step cooling treatment  Axens uses to consider that the step cooling treatment should only be mandatory for  equipments for which the operating temperature is above 350°C which should typically be  the case for the present steel grade. Final decision to be given by Contractor/Owner  In the aim at assessing the Temper Embrittlement detrimental effect on plates, forgings and  welding, transition curves (Impact energy versus Temperature) has to be plotted before and  after step cooling test. Test specimen status definition, and step cooling procedure as well,  have to be submitted to Contractor/Owner approval.  Unless otherwise specified by client or detail engineering, the Step Cooling Treatment shall  be carried out on the thickest plate issued from the Heat showing the highest J factor.  The said Treatment will also be carried out on the thickest Plates issued from Heats showing  J factor higher than 80 or P + Sn > 0.012%, if any.  Each qualified welding procedure shall also be submitted to Step cooling test. Transition  curves shall be obtained for the deposited Welding Metal and Heat Affected Zones as well.

The increase in transition temperature (TT55) from its original value  has become an accepted tool for the determination of temper embrittlement susceptibility. In  order to characterize a material for temper embrittlement resistance, a relationship was  developed using the original or “as fabricated” TT55 and the increase in TT55 (delta TT55).  After step cooling heat treatment, for impact properties (Charpy-V at ¼ T and ½ T material  thickness) should meet the following requirements:    TT55 + 2.5 delta TT55 lower than or equal to 10°C    Where TT55 is the 55 Joules transition temperature   and delta TT55 is (TT55 [step cooled] - TT55 [original value])    Note: Major steel vendors use to propose step-cooling treatment surrendering, for base  material, based on their know-how and demonstrated experiences provided that the specified  impact test energy criterion is verified at temperature of -60°C or below while measured J  factor is below 100. It is assumed that the available extra-clean steels shall allow obtaining  such high resilience and CVN-Energy levels.   Even if final decision remain at the Owner/Contractor discretion for base material, one shall  note that all Welding Qualification must undergo dedicated Step Cooling test (CVN impact  energy obtained from product coupons will have to be in accordance with the one obtained  during Qualification phase).     2.1.3.5 Hardness properties  The material hardness shall not exceed 235 HB.    2.1.3.6 Responsibility for Base material Tests  Mechanical tests may be performed by the base materials Manufacturer or the reactor  Manufacturer.

WELDING  3.1 General  The vessel Manufacturer shall not subcontract fabrication involving welding to others without  the written approval of the Contractor.  The plate, or forging edge preparation for welding as well as the nozzle openings will be  carried out by machining. Flame cutting may sometimes be allowed by the Contractor  provided the heat affected zone is completely removed by machining or grinding (ex: Nozzles  openings in shell or head).    3.2 Welding processes  - SAW : Submerged Arc Welding  The Manufacturer and brand name or grade of all welding consumables shall be  specified in the welding procedure and submitted to the Contractor for approval.  - SMAW : Shielded Manual Arc Welding  Only low hydrogen electrodes shall be used (refer to ASME II Part C SFA 5.5).  Dedicated procedure for electrodes drying/conditioning shall be submitted to Contractor  for approval.  - GTAW : Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (mainly for nozzles)  Remark:    - FCAW : Flux Cored Arc Welding may be considered as acceptable.  - GMAW : Gas Metal Arc Welding may be used for welds not subjected to pressure.    Notes:   - All the pressure retaining welds in hydrogen service , including the internals welded  on pressure parts, have to be full penetration type. If this is not possible, there will be a vent  drill-hole of the not welded area. External attachments are not concerned  - Only approved WPS with WPQR are to be used for fabrication. Welding procedures  submitted to the contractor shall include details variables and welding parameters for each  used welding process. Qualification test shall be made using filler metal, flux and / or inert  gases of same type, brand, chemistry and size as the ones to be used on work.  - Coupons to be used for Qualification test shall be heat treated in the same manner as  specified for the plate test as given in 2.1.3.

CLADDING OR WELD OVERLAY  4.1 Cladding  High-Alloy clad materials shall be in accordance with the ASME Section II, Part A,  Specification SA-264 for Chromium-Nickel Steels.  Cladding shall be 3mm minimum thickness SA-240 or as specified on the drawings. A  140Mpa minimum shear strength per SA-264 is required. The clad plate shall be  ultrasonically examined in accordance with SA-578 supplementary requirements S7 using  Level 1 acceptance criteria.    4.2 Weld Overlay  Generally speaking (when clad is specified as SS 321 or SS 347, or overlay is specified as   SS 347, on data sheet), the weld overlay is applied using a two-layers technique as follows:  - First layer : 309L SS  - Second layer : 347 SS (type 321SS shall not be permitted)  - Minimum effective thickness of undiluted alloy (after final machining if any) shall be those  required on equipment data sheet specification.  However, single layer weld deposit overlay (type 309LNb as typical) may be used provided  the fabricator can demonstrate to the contractor the use of a qualified and acceptable  procedure.  Note 1: When clad is specified as SS 317L or overlay is specified as SS 317L on data sheet,  the weld overlay is applied using a two-layers technique as follow:  - First layer:  309LMo SS or 309L SS  - Second layer:  317L  (Single layer not allowed)  Note 2: The number of weld layers in production shall not be less than the number of layers  deposited for weld overlay procedure qualification tests.  When required by the Owner/User, a method to evaluate the weld overlay for susceptibility to  hydrogen disbonding shall be agreed to between the Fabricator and Owner/User. In such  case, the Owner/User shall define testing requirements and acceptance criteria. An example  of a standard disbonding test may be found in ASTM G 146.  Welding processes are the same than in  paragraph 3-2,  using strips or wires for SAW  process.  GMAW process is not allowed, except for structural attachments welding on overlay.  FCAW with gas shielding may also be used for some limited location such as overlay on Cr- Mo joint, internal support rings, etc.  Both of GMAW and FCAW processes shall be authorized by the Contractor. As the same  manner, the use of Electroslag (ESW) process remains subject to Contractor’s acceptance.  STANDARD MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS   Réf.  Rév.

Ferrite content is typically determined by the as-deposited chemical composition and the  WRC-diagram.    4.4 Nozzles and Manways  Nozzles and Manways (neck, flange, blind) in clad vessels, or in clad section of vessels, shall  be of the same base material as the vessel and internally clad, or overlaid, with the same  high alloy.  Loose lining, lap-joint flanges, welding of nozzle of different material than the vessel is not  permitted.

POST WELD HEAT TREATMENT  The equipment shall receive PWHT as required by ASME and/or applicable code cases.  Final PWHT modifies the microstructure of the weld metal and of the Heat Affected Zones. It  gives the best metallurgical asset of the weldment.  Unless otherwise specified by steel maker a typical recommended range of temperature  could be 690-720°C – Holding time by reactor manufacturer according to wall thickness and  code and taking into account the anticipated number of heat treatment cycles.  Note: Vessel Manufacturer has the full responsibility of the mechanical behavior of the  vessel. For this reason, PWHT specification shall be optimized and defined by himself (in  accordance with steel Manufacturer) so as to guaranty, at one and the same time,  mechanical and toughness characteristics on the delivered equipment.   Given typical temperature range may accordingly be reconsidered so as to get the fine  balance between strength and toughness..  Intermediate Heat treatments definition is under vessel vendor scope and shall be approved  by Contractor,  - ISR (intermediate stress relieving) uses to reduce the hydrogen content in the welds  and reduces residual stresses in the welded joints as well. The temperature for ISR is  typically led in between 650°C-680°C while holding time will depend on thickness  (min. 2h). Different holding temperature may be accepted when vessel manufacturer  has good fabrication experience. To be approved by Contractor. It is the standard  practice to require ISR for restrained welds such as nozzle attachment welds and  main welds that will not be immediately postweld heat treated.  - DHT (Dehydrogenation Treatment) only uses to reduce the hydrogen content in the  welds to prevent from hydrogen induced cracking. This alternative lower temperature  HT should be addressed on a case-by-case basis considering the low as-welded  toughness of V-modified steels and the induced risks. DHT shall not be allowed  without getting prior approval of the Contractor. This heat treatment is performed at  around 350°C (min.4h) ) thus limiting the Cr carbide precipitation in stainless steel  weld overlay if any. However, if vessel manufacturer has previous experience with  lower temperature and holding time he may propose other conditions supported by  data.  All welding (including potential weld repairs) will be completed before final PWHT excepted  where special care has been taken to avoid necessity of PWHT (buttering with high alloy  deposits).  Note: Local PWHT shall not be permitted. In case of any furnace size limitation, vessel  Manufacturer shall obtain specific derogation from the Contractor to perform local PWHT at  the closing seam of shell.

NON DESTRUCTIVE TESTING BY FABRICATOR  For vessels designed and constructed in accordance with the rules of ASME Section VIII,  Div.1, Inspection Plan and Testing Plan shall be submitted to Engineering (EPC) for  approval.  For vessels designed and constructed in accordance with the rules of ASME Section VIII,  Div.2, non destructive examination (NDE) as a minimum shall comply with the Table AF- 241.1.    6.1 Minimum requirements  Minimum requirements for NDE should typically include the following non-destructive tests :  - Radiographic examination (RT) on all pressure welds (prior to PWHT only, provided  that UT is made before and after PWHT). RT is not so effective after PWHT for detecting  potential cracks. RT is sensitive for volumetric flaw such as slugs inclusion but not  sensitive for shape cracks which could appear during PWHT. Nevertheless, the final  decision, relative to RT examination sequences, belongs to the Contractor  - Use of the TOFD (Time Of Flight Diffraction) techniques in place of RT can be  proposed  by Vendor. Even if permitted by Code case, this shall be submitted to  Owner/Contractor approval  - Ultrasonic examination (UT) for all pressure welds (prior/after PWHT and after  hydrotest),  - Positive Material Identification (PMI) on all alloyed material if any (cladding, overlay,  etc.),  - Mill test report shall be supplied for all materials,  - Magnetic Particles Examination (MT) after PWHT,  - Dye penetrant examination (PT) of all weld overlay surfaces after PWHT.  Note: If Vendor can duly establish that weld-overlay has been performed continuously, thus  guarantying that no change in welding conditions has been encountered while depositing on  vessel shell, then PT could be performed on some representative w/o width lines only.  Procedure’s acceptance shall be submitted to Owner/Contractor decision. Whatever the  approved procedure will be, 100% complementary visual inspection always remains  mandatory.  - Hardness measurement.  - In case of cladding and/or overlay, Ferrite checking (magnetic ferriscope) in addition  to ferrite evaluation based upon sampling and chemical analysis. Acceptance criteria  of ferrite content by magnetic ferriscope shall be 3% to 10%. Magnetic instrument  shall be calibrated and certified per AWS A4-2.  STANDARD MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS   Réf.  Rév.

IN-MOD.dot / Rév. 5 du 19.03.2010  IN-42.3-5.1 Std material spec Low alloyed steels for pressure vessels.doc  GENERAL COMMENTS    The information given hereafter for \"Base Metal Quality\" and \"Welding\" results from  AXENS/IFP wide and significant experience in the low alloyed steels made pressure vessels  specification/operation and mostly in the field of hydro-processing and reforming units.  Specific codes, as well as Client and Engineering Contractor Standards may also influence  the choice in materials and methods. Therefore, the given specifications shall be considered  as minimum requirements and should consequently be used by the Engineering Contractor  during call-for-bid.  The data given here, are defined in the aim at giving an appropriated quality and safety level  for these critical equipments. It should not in any case interfere with Contractor’s  specification relative to design, manufacturing and inspection of the equipment. In case of  any discrepancy between specifications, and for lack of any official derogating decision  issued by the Owner or the Contractor, then the more stringent requirement shall govern.      PREAMBLE:    The use of V-modified Cr-Mo steels is, for many years, considered as an enhancing  specification compared to corresponding conventional Cr-Mo steels.   Beyond the well-known improvement of design stress intensity resulting in thinner and lighter  reactors, they also offer an increased resistance to hydrogen damages, a lower susceptibility  to temper embrittlement and also a better resistance to weld overlay disbonding and creep  phenomena.  Fine, globular shape, stable and well distributed Vanadium carbides do favorably act in  providing excellent benefits to these steels.  Nevertheless, this steel grade should never be specified without considering its inherent  weakness in term of limited toughness and reduced weldability which require specific and  dedicated manufacturing and heat treatment procedures. Vendor should then be able to  establish its capability and its similar experience by demonstrating how dedicated  carefulness is applied all along fabrication steps.   Moreover, vendor shall typically assure a close cooperation with the steel supplier itself so as  to finally get the fine balance between the different specifications herein given.

The increase in transition temperature (TT55) from its original value  has become an accepted tool for the determination of temper embrittlement susceptibility. In  order to characterize a material for temper embrittlement resistance, a relationship was  developed using the original or “as fabricated” TT55 and the increase in TT55 (delta TT55).  After step cooling heat treatment, for impact properties (Charpy-V at ¼ T and ½ T material  thickness) should meet the following requirements:    TT55 + 2.5 delta TT55 lower than or equal to 10°C    Where TT55 is the 55 Joules transition temperature   and delta TT55 is (TT55 [step cooled] - TT55 [original value])    Note: Major steel vendors use to propose step-cooling treatment surrendering, for base  material, based on their know-how and demonstrated experiences provided that the specified  impact test energy criterion is verified at temperature of -60°C or below while measured J  factor is below 100. It is assumed that the available extra-clean steels shall allow obtaining  such high resilience and CVN-Energy levels.   Even if final decision remain at the Owner/Contractor discretion for base material, one shall  note that all Welding Qualification must undergo dedicated Step Cooling test (CVN impact  energy obtained from product coupons will have to be in accordance with the one obtained  during Qualification phase).     2.1.3.5 Hardness properties  The material hardness shall not exceed 235 HB.    2.1.3.6 Responsibility for Base material Tests  Mechanical tests may be performed by the base materials Manufacturer or the reactor  Manufacturer.

WELDING  3.1 General  The vessel Manufacturer shall not subcontract fabrication involving welding to others without  the written approval of the Contractor.  The plate, or forging edge preparation for welding as well as the nozzle openings will be  carried out by machining. Flame cutting may sometimes be allowed by the Contractor  provided the heat affected zone is completely removed by machining or grinding (ex: Nozzles  openings in shell or head).    3.2 Welding processes  - SAW : Submerged Arc Welding  The Manufacturer and brand name or grade of all welding consumables shall be  specified in the welding procedure and submitted to the Contractor for approval.  - SMAW : Shielded Manual Arc Welding  Only low hydrogen electrodes shall be used (refer to ASME II Part C SFA 5.5).

Notes:   - All the pressure retaining welds in hydrogen service , including the internals welded  on pressure parts, have to be full penetration type. If this is not possible, there will be a vent  drill-hole of the not welded area. External attachments are not concerned  - Only approved WPS with WPQR are to be used for fabrication. Welding procedures  submitted to the contractor shall include details variables and welding parameters for each  used welding process. Qualification test shall be made using filler metal, flux and / or inert  gases of same type, brand, chemistry and size as the ones to be used on work.  - Coupons to be used for Qualification test shall be heat treated in the same manner as  specified for the plate test as given in 2.1.3.

CLADDING OR WELD OVERLAY  4.1 Cladding  High-Alloy clad materials shall be in accordance with the ASME Section II, Part A,  Specification SA-264 for Chromium-Nickel Steels.  Cladding shall be 3mm minimum thickness SA-240 or as specified on the drawings. A  140Mpa minimum shear strength per SA-264 is required. The clad plate shall be  ultrasonically examined in accordance with SA-578 supplementary requirements S7 using  Level 1 acceptance criteria.    4.2 Weld Overlay  Generally speaking (when clad is specified as SS 321 or SS 347, or overlay is specified as   SS 347, on data sheet), the weld overlay is applied using a two-layers technique as follows:  - First layer : 309L SS  - Second layer : 347 SS (type 321SS shall not be permitted)  - Minimum effective thickness of undiluted alloy (after final machining if any) shall be those  required on equipment data sheet specification.  However, single layer weld deposit overlay (type 309LNb as typical) may be used provided  the fabricator can demonstrate to the contractor the use of a qualified and acceptable  procedure.  Note 1: When clad is specified as SS 317L or overlay is specified as SS 317L on data sheet,  the weld overlay is applied using a two-layers technique as follow:  - First layer:  309LMo SS or 309L SS  - Second layer:  317L  (Single layer not allowed)  Note 2: The number of weld layers in production shall not be less than the number of layers  deposited for weld overlay procedure qualification tests.  When required by the Owner/User, a method to evaluate the weld overlay for susceptibility to  hydrogen disbonding shall be agreed to between the Fabricator and Owner/User. In such  case, the Owner/User shall define testing requirements and acceptance criteria. An example  of a standard disbonding test may be found in ASTM G 146.  Welding processes are the same than in  paragraph 3-2,  using strips or wires for SAW  process.  GMAW process is not allowed, except for structural attachments welding on overlay.  FCAW with gas shielding may also be used for some limited location such as overlay on Cr- Mo joint, internal support rings, etc.  Both of GMAW and FCAW processes shall be authorized by the Contractor. As the same  manner, the use of Electroslag (ESW) process remains subject to Contractor’s acceptance.  STANDARD MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS   Réf.  Rév.

Ferrite content is typically determined by the as-deposited chemical composition and the  WRC-diagram.    4.4 Nozzles and Manways  Nozzles and Manways (neck, flange, blind) in clad vessels, or in clad section of vessels, shall  be of the same base material as the vessel and internally clad, or overlaid, with the same  high alloy.  Loose lining, lap-joint flanges, welding of nozzle of different material than the vessel is not  permitted.   The thickness of the cladding or overlay shall be at least equal to that of the cladding or  overlay of the vessel.    STANDARD MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS   Réf.  Rév.

POST WELD HEAT TREATMENT  The equipment shall receive PWHT as required by ASME and/or applicable code cases.  Final PWHT modifies the microstructure of the weld metal and of the Heat Affected Zones. It  gives the best metallurgical asset of the weldment.  Unless otherwise specified by steel maker a typical recommended range of temperature  could be 690-720°C – Holding time by reactor manufacturer according to wall thickness and  code and taking into account the anticipated number of heat treatment cycles.  Note: Vessel Manufacturer has the full responsibility of the mechanical behavior of the  vessel. For this reason, PWHT specification shall be optimized and defined by himself (in  accordance with steel Manufacturer) so as to guaranty, at one and the same time,  mechanical and toughness characteristics on the delivered equipment.   Given typical temperature range may accordingly be reconsidered so as to get the fine  balance between strength and toughness..  Intermediate Heat treatments definition is under vessel vendor scope and shall be approved  by Contractor,  - ISR (intermediate stress relieving) uses to reduce the hydrogen content in the welds  and reduces residual stresses in the welded joints as well. The temperature for ISR is  typically led in between 650°C-680°C while holding time will depend on thickness  (min. 2h). Different holding temperature may be accepted when vessel manufacturer  has good fabrication experience. To be approved by Contractor. It is the standard  practice to require ISR for restrained welds such as nozzle attachment welds and  main welds that will not be immediately postweld heat treated.  - DHT (Dehydrogenation Treatment) only uses to reduce the hydrogen content in the  welds to prevent from hydrogen induced cracking. This alternative lower temperature  HT should be addressed on a case-by-case basis considering the low as-welded  toughness of V-modified steels and the induced risks. DHT shall not be allowed  without getting prior approval of the Contractor. This heat treatment is performed at  around 350°C (min.4h) ) thus limiting the Cr carbide precipitation in stainless steel  weld overlay if any. However, if vessel manufacturer has previous experience with  lower temperature and holding time he may propose other conditions supported by  data.  All welding (including potential weld repairs) will be completed before final PWHT excepted  where special care has been taken to avoid necessity of PWHT (buttering with high alloy  deposits).  Note: Local PWHT shall not be permitted. In case of any furnace size limitation, vessel  Manufacturer shall obtain specific derogation from the Contractor to perform local PWHT at  the closing seam of shell.

NON DESTRUCTIVE TESTING BY FABRICATOR  For vessels designed and constructed in accordance with the rules of ASME Section VIII,  Div.1, Inspection Plan and Testing Plan shall be submitted to Engineering (EPC) for  approval.  For vessels designed and constructed in accordance with the rules of ASME Section VIII,  Div.2, non destructive examination (NDE) as a minimum shall comply with the Table AF- 241.1.    6.1 Minimum requirements  Minimum requirements for NDE should typically include the following non-destructive tests :  - Radiographic examination (RT) on all pressure welds (prior to PWHT only, provided  that UT is made before and after PWHT). RT is not so effective after PWHT for detecting  potential cracks. RT is sensitive for volumetric flaw such as slugs inclusion but not  sensitive for shape cracks which could appear during PWHT. Nevertheless, the final  decision, relative to RT examination sequences, belongs to the Contractor  - Use of the TOFD (Time Of Flight Diffraction) techniques in place of RT can be  proposed  by Vendor. Even if permitted by Code case, this shall be submitted to  Owner/Contractor approval  - Ultrasonic examination (UT) for all pressure welds (prior/after PWHT and after  hydrotest),  - Positive Material Identification (PMI) on all alloyed material if any (cladding, overlay,  etc.),  - Mill test report shall be supplied for all materials,  - Magnetic Particles Examination (MT) after PWHT,  - Dye penetrant examination (PT) of all weld overlay surfaces after PWHT.  Note: If Vendor can duly establish that weld-overlay has been performed continuously, thus  guarantying that no change in welding conditions has been encountered while depositing on  vessel shell, then PT could be performed on some representative w/o width lines only.  Procedure’s acceptance shall be submitted to Owner/Contractor decision. Whatever the  approved procedure will be, 100% complementary visual inspection always remains  mandatory.  - Hardness measurement.  - In case of cladding and/or overlay, Ferrite checking (magnetic ferriscope) in addition  to ferrite evaluation based upon sampling and chemical analysis. Acceptance criteria  of ferrite content by magnetic ferriscope shall be 3% to 10%. Magnetic instrument  shall be calibrated and certified per AWS A4-2.  STANDARD MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS   Réf.  Rév.

The average of three impact test values at testing temperature shall not be less than 55J  (40ft.lb) without individual value below 47J (35ft.lb).  Testing temperature shall be the lower of the Minimum Design Metal Temperature (MDMT)  and -30°C(-22°F).  Note: One shall note that sulfur does act on resilience properties and sulfur content shall  consequently be kept as low as possible to obtain high CVN energy.    2.1.3.4 Step cooling treatment  (Equipment to be operated above 350°C)  Axens uses to consider that the step cooling treatment should only be mandatory for  equipments for which the operating temperature is above 350°C. Final decision to be given  by Contractor/Owner.  In the aim at assessing the Temper Embrittlement detrimental effect on plates, forgings and  welding, transition curves (Impact energy versus Temperature) has to be plotted before and  after step cooling test. Test specimen status definition, and step cooling procedure as well,  have to be submitted to Contractor/Owner approval.  Unless otherwise specified by client or detail engineering, the Step Cooling Treatment shall  be carried out on the thickest plate issued from the Heat showing the highest J factor.  The said Treatment will also be carried out on the thickest Plates issued from Heats showing  J factor higher than 80 or P + Sn > 0.012%, if any.  Each qualified welding procedure shall also be submitted to Step cooling test. Transition  curves shall be obtained for the deposited Welding Metal and Heat Affected Zones as well.    Note: Vendor may propose, based on its own experience, to reduce the number of test  coupons by focusing onto the welding procedures which are considered as being the more  detrimental ones regarding the expected embrittlement.

The increase in transition temperature (TT55) from its original value  has become an accepted tool for the determination of temper embrittlement susceptibility. In  order to characterize a material for temper embrittlement resistance, a relationship was  developed using the original or “as fabricated” TT55 and the increase in TT55 (delta TT55).  After step cooling heat treatment, for impact properties (Charpy-V at ¼ T and ½ T material  thickness) should meet the following requirements:    TT55 + 2.5 delta TT55 lower than or equal to 10°C    Where :   TT55 is the 55 Joules transition temperature  and delta TT55 is (TT55 [step cooled] - TT55 [original value])    Note: Major steel vendors use to propose step-cooling treatment surrendering, for base  material, based on their know-how and demonstrated experiences provided that the specified  impact test energy criterion is verified at temperature of -60°C or below while measured J  factor is below 100.

Notes:   -  All the pressure retaining welds in hydrogen service, including the internals welded on  pressure parts, have to be full penetration type. If this is not possible, there will be a  vent drill-hole of the not welded area. External attachments are not concerned  -  Only approved WPS with WPQR are to be used for fabrication. Welding procedures  submitted to the Contractor shall include details variables and welding parameters for  each used welding process. Qualification test shall be made using filler metal, flux  and / or inert gases of same type, brand, chemistry and size as the ones to be used  on work.  -  Coupons to be used for Qualification test shall be heat treated in the same manner as  specified for the plate test as given in 2.1.3.

CLADDING OR WELD OVERLAY  4.1 Cladding  High-Alloy clad materials shall be in accordance with the ASME Section II, Part A,  Specification SA-264 for Chromium-Nickel Steels.  Cladding shall be 3mm minimum thickness SA-240 or as specified on the drawings. A  140MPa minimum shear strength per SA-264 is required. The clad plate shall be  ultrasonically examined in accordance with SA-578 supplementary requirements S7 using  Level 1 acceptance criteria.  4.2 Weld Overlay  Generally speaking (when clad is specified as SS 321 or SS 347, or overlay is specified as  SS 347, on data sheet), the weld overlay is applied using a two-layers technique as follows:  - First layer : 309L SS  - Second layer : 347 SS (type 321SS shall not be permitted)  - Minimum effective thickness of undiluted alloy (after final machining if any) shall be  those required on equipment data sheet specification   However, single layer weld deposit overlay (type 309LNb as typical) may be used  provided the fabricator can demonstrate to the Contractor the use of a qualified and  acceptable procedure.  Note 1: When clad is specified as SS 317L or overlay is specified as SS 317L on data sheet,  the weld overlay is applied using a two-layers technique as follow:  - First layer: 309LMo SS or 309L SS  - Second layer: 317L (Single layer not allowed)  Note 2: The number of weld layers in production shall not be less than the number of layers  deposited for weld overlay procedure qualification tests.  When required by the Owner/User, a method to evaluate the weld overlay for susceptibility to  hydrogen disbonding shall be agreed between the Fabricator and Owner/User. In such a  case, the Owner/User shall define testing requirements and acceptance criteria. An example  of a standard disbonding test may be found in ASTM G 146.  Welding processes are the same than in paragraph 3-2, using strips or wires for SAW  process.  GMAW process is not allowed, except for structural attachments welding on overlay.  FCAW with gas shielding may also be used for some limited location such as overlay on Cr- Mo joint, internal support rings, etc.  Both of GMAW and FCAW processes shall be authorized by the Contractor. As the same  manner, the use of Electroslag (ESW) process remains subject to Contractor’s acceptance.  STANDARD MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS   Réf.  Rév.

POST WELD HEAT TREATMENT  (BY VESSEL FABRICATOR)  The equipment shall receive PWHT as required by ASME and/or applicable Code Cases.  Final PWHT modifies the microstructure of the weld metal and of the Heat Affected Zones. It  gives the best metallurgical asset of the weldment.  Unless otherwise specified by steel maker a typical recommended range of temperature  could be 677°C-703°C. Holding time by reactor manufacturer according to wall thickness and  code and taking into account the anticipated number of heat treatment cycles.    Note: Vessel Manufacturer has the full responsibility of the mechanical behavior of the  vessel. For this reason, PWHT specification shall be optimized and defined by himself (in  accordance with steel Manufacturer) so as to guaranty, at one and the same time,  mechanical and toughness characteristics on the delivered equipment. Given typical  temperature range may accordingly be reconsidered so as to get the fine balance between  strength and toughness.  Intermediate heat treatments definition is under vessel vendor scope and shall be approved  by the Contractor:  - ISR (Intermediate Stress Relieving) uses to reduce the hydrogen content in the welds  and reduces residual stresses in the welded joints as well. The temperature for ISR is  typically led in between 590°C-600°C while holding time will depend on thickness  (min. 2h). Different holding temperature may be accepted when vessel manufacturer  has good fabrication experience. To be approved by Contractor. It is the standard  practice to require ISR for restrained welds such as nozzle attachment welds and  main welds that will not be immediately postweld heat treated (especially for thick  shell, head and nozzles joints).  - DHT (Dehydrogenation Treatment) only uses to reduce the hydrogen content in the  welds to prevent from hydrogen induced cracking. This alternative lower temperature  HT may be allowed only upon approval of the Contractor. This heat treatment is  performed at around 300°C (min.1h) thus limiting the Cr carbide precipitation in  stainless steel weld overlay if any.  All welding (including potential weld repairs) will be completed before final PWHT excepted  where special care has been taken to avoid necessity of PWHT (buttering with high alloy  deposits).    Note: Local PWHT shall not be permitted. In case of any furnace size limitation, vessel  Manufacturer shall obtain specific derogation from the Contractor/Owner to perform local  PWHT at the closing seam of shell.

NON DESTRUCTIVE TESTING BY FABRICATOR  For vessels designed and constructed in accordance with the rules of ASME Section VIII,  Div.1, Inspection Plan and Testing Plan shall be submitted to Engineering (EPC) for  approval.  For vessels designed and constructed in accordance with the rules of ASME Section VIII,  Div.2, non destructive examination (NDE) as a minimum shall comply with the Table AF- 241.1.    6.1 Minimum requirements  Minimum requirements for NDE should typically include the following non-destructive tests:  - Radiographic examination (RT) on all pressure welds (prior to PWHT only, provided that UT  is made before and after PWHT). RT is not so effective after PWHT for detecting potential  cracks. RT is sensitive for volumetric flaw such as slugs inclusion but not sensitive for  shape cracks which could appear during PWHT. Nevertheless, the final decision, relative to  RT examination sequences, belongs to the Contractor,  - Use of the TOFD (Time Of Flight Diffraction) techniques in place of RT can be proposed by  Vendor. Even if permitted by Code case, this shall be submitted to Owner/Contractor  approval,  - Ultrasonic examination (UT) for all pressure welds (prior/after PWHT and after hydrotest),  - Positive Material Identification (PMI) on all alloyed material if any (cladding, overlay, etc.),  - Mill test report shall be supplied for all materials,  - Magnetic Particles Examination (MT) after PWHT,  - Dye penetrant examination (PT) of all weld overlay surfaces after PWHT.    Note: If Vendor can duly establish that weld-overlay has been performed continuously, thus  guarantying that no change in welding conditions has been encountered while depositing on  vessel shell, then PT could be performed on some representative w/o width lines only.  Procedure’s acceptance shall be submitted to Owner/Contractor decision. Whatever the  approved procedure will be, 100% complementary visual inspection always remains  mandatory.  - Hardness measurement.  - In case of cladding and/or overlay, Ferrite checking (magnetic ferriscope) in addition  to ferrite evaluation based upon sampling and chemical analysis. Acceptance criteria  of ferrite content by magnetic ferriscope shall be 3% to 10%. Magnetic instrument  shall be calibrated and certified per AWS A4-2.  STANDARD MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS   Réf.  Rév.

IN-MOD.dot / Rév. 5 du 19.03.2010  IN-42.3-5.1 Std material spec Low alloyed steels for pressure vessels.doc  GENERAL COMMENTS    The information given hereafter for \"Base Metal Quality\" and \"Welding\" results from  AXENS/IFP wide and significant experience in the low alloyed steels made pressure vessels  specification/operation and mostly in the field of hydro-processing and reforming units.  Specific codes, as well as Client and Engineering Contractor Standards may also influence  the choice in materials and methods. Therefore, the given specifications shall be considered  as minimum requirements and should consequently be used by the Engineering Contractor  during call-for-bid.  The data given here, are defined in the aim at giving an appropriated quality and safety level  for these critical equipments. It should not in any case interfere with Contractor’s  specification relative to design, manufacturing and inspection of the equipment. In case of  any discrepancy between specifications, and for lack of any official derogating decision  issued by the Owner or the Contractor, then the more stringent requirement shall govern.      PREAMBLE:    The use of V-modified Cr-Mo steels is, for many years, considered as an enhancing  specification compared to corresponding conventional Cr-Mo steels.   Beyond the well-known improvement of design stress intensity resulting in thinner and lighter  reactors, they also offer an increased resistance to hydrogen damages, a lower susceptibility  to temper embrittlement and also a better resistance to weld overlay disbonding and creep  phenomena.  Fine, globular shape, stable and well distributed Vanadium carbides do favorably act in  providing excellent benefits to these steels.  Nevertheless, this steel grade should never be specified without considering its inherent  weakness in term of limited toughness and reduced weldability which require specific and  dedicated manufacturing and heat treatment procedures. Vendor should then be able to  establish its capability and its similar experience by demonstrating how dedicated  carefulness is applied all along fabrication steps.   Moreover, vendor shall typically assure a close cooperation with the steel supplier itself so as  to finally get the fine balance between the different specifications herein given.

Notes:   - Susceptibility to Temper Embrittlement phenomenon has forced steel producers to restrict  tramp elements contents, mainly P, Sb, Sn, As (in order of decreasing severity in weight  percent basis) which elements can detrimentally diffuse to the grain boundaries while steel is  held within the embrittling temperature range.

Room temperature tensile properties shall meet the requirements of the material standard.  Yield strength at design temperature shall meet the value taken into account in calculation  notes (Ultimate Tensile Strength will be given for information).  Note: For Creep range calculation, Yield and Ultimate Strength may be given for information  at the Owner/EPC discretion.    2.1.3.3 Impact test properties  Charpy V-Notch impact testing is required for all pressure retaining components, welds and  heat affected zones (HAZ).  The average of three impact test values at testing temperature shall not be less than 55J  (40ft.lb) without individual value below 47J (35ft.lb).  Testing temperature shall be the lower of the Minimum Design Metal Temperature (MDMT)  and -18°C (0°F).  Note: One shall note that sulfur does act on resilience properties and sulfur content shall  consequently be kept as low as possible to obtain high CVN energy.    2.1.3.4 Step cooling treatment  Axens uses to consider that the step cooling treatment should only be mandatory for  equipments for which the operating temperature is above 350°C which should typically be  the case for the present steel grade. Final decision to be given by Contractor/Owner  In the aim at assessing the Temper Embrittlement detrimental effect on plates, forgings and  welding, transition curves (Impact energy versus Temperature) has to be plotted before and  after step cooling test. Test specimen status definition, and step cooling procedure as well,  have to be submitted to Contractor/Owner approval.  Unless otherwise specified by client or detail engineering, the Step Cooling Treatment shall  be carried out on the thickest plate issued from the Heat showing the highest J factor.  The said Treatment will also be carried out on the thickest Plates issued from Heats showing  J factor higher than 80 or P + Sn > 0.012%, if any.  Each qualified welding procedure shall also be submitted to Step cooling test. Transition  curves shall be obtained for the deposited Welding Metal and Heat Affected Zones as well.  Note: Vendor may propose, based on its own experience, to reduce the number of test  coupons by focusing onto the welding procedures which are considered as being the more  detrimental ones regarding the expected embrittlement.

The increase in transition temperature (TT55) from its original value  has become an accepted tool for the determination of temper embrittlement susceptibility. In  order to characterize a material for temper embrittlement resistance, a relationship was  developed using the original or “as fabricated” TT55 and the increase in TT55 (delta TT55).  After step cooling heat treatment, for impact properties (Charpy-V at ¼ T and ½ T material  thickness) should meet the following requirements:    TT55 + 2.5 delta TT55 lower than or equal to 10°C    Where TT55 is the 55 Joules transition temperature   and delta TT55 is (TT55 [step cooled] - TT55 [original value])    Note: Major steel vendors use to propose step-cooling treatment surrendering, for base  material, based on their know-how and demonstrated experiences provided that the specified  impact test energy criterion is verified at temperature of -60°C or below while measured J  factor is below 100. It is assumed that the available extra-clean steels shall allow obtaining  such high resilience and CVN-Energy levels.   Even if final decision remain at the Owner/Contractor discretion for base material, one shall  note that all Welding Qualification must undergo dedicated Step Cooling test (CVN impact  energy obtained from product coupons will have to be in accordance with the one obtained  during Qualification phase).     2.1.3.5 Hardness properties  The material hardness shall not exceed 235 HB.    2.1.3.6 Responsibility for Base material Tests  Mechanical tests may be performed by the base materials Manufacturer or the reactor  Manufacturer.

Notes:   - All the pressure retaining welds in hydrogen service , including the internals welded  on pressure parts, have to be full penetration type. If this is not possible, there will be a vent  drill-hole of the not welded area. External attachments are not concerned  - Only approved WPS with WPQR are to be used for fabrication. Welding procedures  submitted to the contractor shall include details variables and welding parameters for each  used welding process. Qualification test shall be made using filler metal, flux and / or inert  gases of same type, brand, chemistry and size as the ones to be used on work.  - Coupons to be used for Qualification test shall be heat treated in the same manner as  specified for the plate test as given in 2.1.3.

CLADDING OR WELD OVERLAY  4.1 Cladding  High-Alloy clad materials shall be in accordance with the ASME Section II, Part A,  Specification SA-264 for Chromium-Nickel Steels.  Cladding shall be 3mm minimum thickness SA-240 or as specified on the drawings. A  140Mpa minimum shear strength per SA-264 is required. The clad plate shall be  ultrasonically examined in accordance with SA-578 supplementary requirements S7 using  Level 1 acceptance criteria.    4.2 Weld Overlay  Generally speaking (when clad is specified as SS 321 or SS 347, or overlay is specified as   SS 347, on data sheet), the weld overlay is applied using a two-layers technique as follows:  - First layer : 309L SS  - Second layer : 347 SS (type 321SS shall not be permitted)  - Minimum effective thickness of undiluted alloy (after final machining if any) shall be those  required on equipment data sheet specification.  However, single layer weld deposit overlay (type 309LNb as typical) may be used provided  the fabricator can demonstrate to the contractor the use of a qualified and acceptable  procedure.  Note 1: When clad is specified as SS 317L or overlay is specified as SS 317L on data sheet,  the weld overlay is applied using a two-layers technique as follow:  - First layer:  309LMo SS or 309L SS  - Second layer:  317L  (Single layer not allowed)  Note 2: The number of weld layers in production shall not be less than the number of layers  deposited for weld overlay procedure qualification tests.  When required by the Owner/User, a method to evaluate the weld overlay for susceptibility to  hydrogen disbonding shall be agreed to between the Fabricator and Owner/User. In such  case, the Owner/User shall define testing requirements and acceptance criteria. An example  of a standard disbonding test may be found in ASTM G 146.  Welding processes are the same than in  paragraph 3-2,  using strips or wires for SAW  process.  GMAW process is not allowed, except for structural attachments welding on overlay.  FCAW with gas shielding may also be used for some limited location such as overlay on Cr- Mo joint, internal support rings, etc.  Both of GMAW and FCAW processes shall be authorized by the Contractor. As the same  manner, the use of Electroslag (ESW) process remains subject to Contractor’s acceptance.  STANDARD MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS   Réf.  Rév.

Ferrite content is typically determined by the as-deposited chemical composition and the  WRC-diagram.    4.4 Nozzles and Manways  Nozzles and Manways (neck, flange, blind) in clad vessels, or in clad section of vessels, shall  be of the same base material as the vessel and internally clad, or overlaid, with the same  high alloy.  Loose lining, lap-joint flanges, welding of nozzle of different material than the vessel is not  permitted.

POST WELD HEAT TREATMENT  The equipment shall receive PWHT as required by ASME and/or applicable code cases.  Final PWHT modifies the microstructure of the weld metal and of the Heat Affected Zones. It  gives the best metallurgical asset of the weldment.  Unless otherwise specified by steel maker a typical recommended range of temperature  could be 690-720°C – Holding time by reactor manufacturer according to wall thickness and  code and taking into account the anticipated number of heat treatment cycles.  Note: Vessel Manufacturer has the full responsibility of the mechanical behavior of the  vessel. For this reason, PWHT specification shall be optimized and defined by himself (in  accordance with steel Manufacturer) so as to guaranty, at one and the same time,  mechanical and toughness characteristics on the delivered equipment.   Given typical temperature range may accordingly be reconsidered so as to get the fine  balance between strength and toughness..  Intermediate Heat treatments definition is under vessel vendor scope and shall be approved  by Contractor,  - ISR (intermediate stress relieving) uses to reduce the hydrogen content in the welds  and reduces residual stresses in the welded joints as well. The temperature for ISR is  typically led in between 650°C-680°C while holding time will depend on thickness  (min. 2h). Different holding temperature may be accepted when vessel manufacturer  has good fabrication experience. To be approved by Contractor. It is the standard  practice to require ISR for restrained welds such as nozzle attachment welds and  main welds that will not be immediately postweld heat treated.  - DHT (Dehydrogenation Treatment) only uses to reduce the hydrogen content in the  welds to prevent from hydrogen induced cracking. This alternative lower temperature  HT should be addressed on a case-by-case basis considering the low as-welded  toughness of V-modified steels and the induced risks. DHT shall not be allowed  without getting prior approval of the Contractor. This heat treatment is performed at  around 350°C (min.4h) ) thus limiting the Cr carbide precipitation in stainless steel  weld overlay if any. However, if vessel manufacturer has previous experience with  lower temperature and holding time he may propose other conditions supported by  data.  All welding (including potential weld repairs) will be completed before final PWHT excepted  where special care has been taken to avoid necessity of PWHT (buttering with high alloy  deposits).  Note: Local PWHT shall not be permitted. In case of any furnace size limitation, vessel  Manufacturer shall obtain specific derogation from the Contractor to perform local PWHT at  the closing seam of shell.

NON DESTRUCTIVE TESTING BY FABRICATOR  For vessels designed and constructed in accordance with the rules of ASME Section VIII,  Div.1, Inspection Plan and Testing Plan shall be submitted to Engineering (EPC) for  approval.  For vessels designed and constructed in accordance with the rules of ASME Section VIII,  Div.2, non destructive examination (NDE) as a minimum shall comply with the Table AF- 241.1.    6.1 Minimum requirements  Minimum requirements for NDE should typically include the following non-destructive tests :  - Radiographic examination (RT) on all pressure welds (prior to PWHT only, provided  that UT is made before and after PWHT). RT is not so effective after PWHT for detecting  potential cracks. RT is sensitive for volumetric flaw such as slugs inclusion but not  sensitive for shape cracks which could appear during PWHT. Nevertheless, the final  decision, relative to RT examination sequences, belongs to the Contractor  - Use of the TOFD (Time Of Flight Diffraction) techniques in place of RT can be  proposed  by Vendor. Even if permitted by Code case, this shall be submitted to  Owner/Contractor approval  - Ultrasonic examination (UT) for all pressure welds (prior/after PWHT and after  hydrotest),  - Positive Material Identification (PMI) on all alloyed material if any (cladding, overlay,  etc.),  - Mill test report shall be supplied for all materials,  - Magnetic Particles Examination (MT) after PWHT,  - Dye penetrant examination (PT) of all weld overlay surfaces after PWHT.  Note: If Vendor can duly establish that weld-overlay has been performed continuously, thus  guarantying that no change in welding conditions has been encountered while depositing on  vessel shell, then PT could be performed on some representative w/o width lines only.  Procedure’s acceptance shall be submitted to Owner/Contractor decision. Whatever the  approved procedure will be, 100% complementary visual inspection always remains  mandatory.  - Hardness measurement.  - In case of cladding and/or overlay, Ferrite checking (magnetic ferriscope) in addition  to ferrite evaluation based upon sampling and chemical analysis. Acceptance criteria  of ferrite content by magnetic ferriscope shall be 3% to 10%. Magnetic instrument  shall be calibrated and certified per AWS A4-2.  STANDARD MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS   Réf.  Rév.

IN-MOD.dot / Rév. 5 du 19.03.2010  IN-42.3-5.1 Std material spec Low alloyed steels for pressure vessels.doc  GENERAL COMMENTS    The information given hereafter for \"Base Metal Quality\" and \"Welding\" results from  AXENS/IFP wide and significant experience in the low alloyed steels made pressure vessels  specification/operation and mostly in the field of hydro-processing and reforming units.  Specific codes, as well as Client and Engineering Contractor Standards may also influence  the choice in materials and methods. Therefore, the given specifications shall be considered  as minimum requirements and should consequently be used by the Engineering Contractor  during call-for-bid.  The data given here, are defined in the aim at giving an appropriated quality and safety level  for these critical equipments. It should not in any case interfere with Contractor’s  specification relative to design, manufacturing and inspection of the equipment. In case of  any discrepancy between specifications, and for lack of any official derogating decision  issued by the Owner or the Contractor, then the more stringent requirement shall govern.      PREAMBLE:    The use of V-modified Cr-Mo steels is, for many years, considered as an enhancing  specification compared to corresponding conventional Cr-Mo steels.   Beyond the well-known improvement of design stress intensity resulting in thinner and lighter  reactors, they also offer an increased resistance to hydrogen damages, a lower susceptibility  to temper embrittlement and also a better resistance to weld overlay disbonding and creep  phenomena.  Fine, globular shape, stable and well distributed Vanadium carbides do favorably act in  providing excellent benefits to these steels.  Nevertheless, this steel grade should never be specified without considering its inherent  weakness in term of limited toughness and reduced weldability which require specific and  dedicated manufacturing and heat treatment procedures. Vendor should then be able to  establish its capability and its similar experience by demonstrating how dedicated  carefulness is applied all along fabrication steps.   Moreover, vendor shall typically assure a close cooperation with the steel supplier itself so as  to finally get the fine balance between the different specifications herein given.

Nevertheless, basic oxygen furnace process with heated ladle refining and vacuum  degassing may also be considered as acceptable,  All plates shall be thermally treated either by annealing, normalizing-and-tempering, or, when  permitted by the purchaser, accelerated cooling from the austenitizing temperature by air  blasting or liquid quenching, followed by tempering,  Heat treatments holding time shall be sufficient to obtain an uniform temperature throughout  the plate,  The tempering temperature shall be adapted so as to give the required mechanical  properties after post-weld heat treatment. It shall consequently be noted that, depending on  cases, the Minimum temperature of Tempering may sometimes be higher than the one  defined for the final Post-Weld Heat Treatment of the equipment.    2.1.2 Chemical analysis  Applications for which V-modified grade is specified will typically be operated at high  temperature (i.e. above 350°C). As a consequence, potential metallurgical embrittling  phenomena shall be properly anticipated during design and manufacturing phases.  Countermeasures including specific chemical analysis given here-below shall consequently  be considered and that whatever the values specified by the construction codes.

IN-MOD.dot / Rév. 5 du 19.03.2010  IN-42.3-5.1 Std material spec Low alloyed steels for pressure vessels.doc  In view of minimizing the risk of temper embrittlement, the \"J\" factor shall verify the relation  hereafter :    J lower than 100 (target 80)  with J = (Si + Mn) * (P + Sn) * 104      All elements mentioned here above, specified in weight percentages, have to be checked on  ladle and on product.     Notes:   - Susceptibility to Temper Embrittlement phenomenon has forced steel producers to restrict  tramp elements contents, mainly P, Sb, Sn, As (in order of decreasing severity in weight  percent basis) which elements can detrimentally diffuse to the grain boundaries while steel is  held within the embrittling temperature range.   This criterion and also the specified impurities level shall uniformly be guarantied for the  whole vessel, including the shell, heads and all other plates made pressure retaining parts as  well (e.g. nozzle parts, elbows, etc.).    2.1.3 Mechanical properties  2.1.3.1 Test specimens  As per code requirements SA20 / SA370 unless otherwise specified by the project  For wall thicknesses above or equal to 50mm, location of the Test specimens shall be in  accordance with section 5.5.1.1 of API 934,  The impact tests shall be carried out after heat treatments simulating those anticipated along  the fabrication that is post-forming heat treatment and intermediate HT, if any, and also final  PWHT  The Mechanical tests shall be carried out after heat treatments simulating those anticipated  along the fabrication that is post-forming heat treatment, intermediate HT, if any, and final  PWHT plus additional heat treatments to anticipate potential repair (number to be defined by  Contractor/Owner).  All tensile, impact, temper embrittlement and hardness testing on heat affected zones (HAZ)  shall be carried out on samples from production weld test plates.

IN-MOD.dot / Rév. 5 du 19.03.2010  IN-42.3-5.1 Std material spec Low alloyed steels for pressure vessels.doc  2.1.3.2 Tensile properties  Tensile tests shall be carried out at room temperature for both ends of each plate (Tensile  tests at design temperature may be requested for information, depending on the Contractor  specification).  Room temperature tensile properties shall meet the requirements of the material standard.  Yield strength at design temperature shall meet the value taken into account in calculation  notes (Ultimate Tensile Strength will be given for information).  Note: For Creep range calculation, Yield and Ultimate Strength may be given for information  at the Owner/EPC discretion.    2.1.3.3 Impact test properties  Charpy V-Notch impact testing is required for all pressure retaining components, welds and  heat affected zones (HAZ).  The average of three impact test values at testing temperature shall not be less than 55J  (40ft.lb) without individual value below 47J (35ft.lb).  Testing temperature shall be the lower of the Minimum Design Metal Temperature (MDMT)  and -18°C (0°F).  Note: One shall note that sulfur does act on resilience properties and sulfur content shall  consequently be kept as low as possible to obtain high CVN energy.    2.1.3.4 Step cooling treatment  Axens uses to consider that the step cooling treatment should only be mandatory for  equipments for which the operating temperature is above 350°C which should typically be  the case for the present steel grade. Final decision to be given by Contractor/Owner  In the aim at assessing the Temper Embrittlement detrimental effect on plates, forgings and  welding, transition curves (Impact energy versus Temperature) has to be plotted before and  after step cooling test. Test specimen status definition, and step cooling procedure as well,  have to be submitted to Contractor/Owner approval.  Unless otherwise specified by client or detail engineering, the Step Cooling Treatment shall  be carried out on the thickest plate issued from the Heat showing the highest J factor.  The said Treatment will also be carried out on the thickest Plates issued from Heats showing  J factor higher than 80 or P + Sn > 0.012%, if any.  Each qualified welding procedure shall also be submitted to Step cooling test. Transition  curves shall be obtained for the deposited Welding Metal and Heat Affected Zones as well.  Note: Vendor may propose, based on its own experience, to reduce the number of test  coupons by focusing onto the welding procedures which are considered as being the more  detrimental ones regarding the expected embrittlement. Final decision remains at  Contractor/Owner discretion     STANDARD MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS   Réf.  Rév.

IN-MOD.dot / Rév. 5 du 19.03.2010  IN-42.3-5.1 Std material spec Low alloyed steels for pressure vessels.doc  For information only, a typical step cooling sequence could be:  Heat to 595°C Hold for 1 hour, cool at 6°C/h max. to 540°C  Heat to 540°C Hold for 15 hours, cool at 6°C/h max. to 525°C  Heat to 525°C Hold for 24 hours, cool at 6°C/h max. to 495°C  Heat to 495°C Hold for 60 hours, cool at 3°C/h max. to 470°C  Heat to 470°C Hold for 100 hours, cool at 28°C/h max. at 315°C and then air cooling    This simulated isothermal embrittlement results in a certain increase (shift) of the material’s  transition temperature. The increase in transition temperature (TT55) from its original value  has become an accepted tool for the determination of temper embrittlement susceptibility. In  order to characterize a material for temper embrittlement resistance, a relationship was  developed using the original or “as fabricated” TT55 and the increase in TT55 (delta TT55).  After step cooling heat treatment, for impact properties (Charpy-V at ¼ T and ½ T material  thickness) should meet the following requirements:    TT55 + 2.5 delta TT55 lower than or equal to 10°C    Where TT55 is the 55 Joules transition temperature   and delta TT55 is (TT55 [step cooled] - TT55 [original value])    Note: Major steel vendors use to propose step-cooling treatment surrendering, for base  material, based on their know-how and demonstrated experiences provided that the specified  impact test energy criterion is verified at temperature of -60°C or below while measured J  factor is below 100. It is assumed that the available extra-clean steels shall allow obtaining  such high resilience and CVN-Energy levels.   Even if final decision remain at the Owner/Contractor discretion for base material, one shall  note that all Welding Qualification must undergo dedicated Step Cooling test (CVN impact  energy obtained from product coupons will have to be in accordance with the one obtained  during Qualification phase).     2.1.3.5 Hardness properties  The material hardness shall not exceed 235 HB.    2.1.3.6 Responsibility for Base material Tests  Mechanical tests may be performed by the base materials Manufacturer or the reactor  Manufacturer. The Mechanical Tests shall allow ensuring that the minimum mechanical  properties required will be met after all anticipated heat treatments of the reactor during and  after fabrication.

WELDING  3.1 General  The vessel Manufacturer shall not subcontract fabrication involving welding to others without  the written approval of the Contractor.  The plate, or forging edge preparation for welding as well as the nozzle openings will be  carried out by machining. Flame cutting may sometimes be allowed by the Contractor  provided the heat affected zone is completely removed by machining or grinding (ex: Nozzles  openings in shell or head).    3.2 Welding processes  - SAW : Submerged Arc Welding  The Manufacturer and brand name or grade of all welding consumables shall be  specified in the welding procedure and submitted to the Contractor for approval.  - SMAW : Shielded Manual Arc Welding  Only low hydrogen electrodes shall be used (refer to ASME II Part C SFA 5.5).

Notes:   - All the pressure retaining welds in hydrogen service , including the internals welded  on pressure parts, have to be full penetration type. If this is not possible, there will be a vent  drill-hole of the not welded area. External attachments are not concerned  - Only approved WPS with WPQR are to be used for fabrication. Welding procedures  submitted to the contractor shall include details variables and welding parameters for each  used welding process. Qualification test shall be made using filler metal, flux and / or inert  gases of same type, brand, chemistry and size as the ones to be used on work.  - Coupons to be used for Qualification test shall be heat treated in the same manner as  specified for the plate test as given in 2.1.3.

Note: Main alloying components such as Chromium, Molybdenum and Vanadium contents of  the weld deposits shall be within the range specified in ASME Section II, Part C for the  specified electrodes.    Material Certificates shall be delivered for each batch, lot, diameter of covered electrodes,  wire/flux combination to be used for fabrication.    Note: A procedure for flux conditioning so as to guarantee a potential diffusible hydrogen  content consistent with the recommendations of the welding consumables manufacturer shall  be submitted to contractor’s approval. As the same manner, the procedure for electrodes  conditioning shall also be submitted for approval.    Furthermore the high purity level of the steel shall be such that P, Sn, Sb and As be as low  as possible to meet BRUSCATO parameter in the weld deposit as follows:  X lower than 15ppm (target 12ppm)  with X= (10P+4Sn+5Sb+As)/100  (All chemical elements specified in ppm)    Note: Contractor may also require for some PMI (Positive Material Identification) to be  applied on deposited metal in the aim at checking the steel grade conformity.

CLADDING OR WELD OVERLAY  4.1 Cladding  High-Alloy clad materials shall be in accordance with the ASME Section II, Part A,  Specification SA-264 for Chromium-Nickel Steels.  Cladding shall be 3mm minimum thickness SA-240 or as specified on the drawings. A  140Mpa minimum shear strength per SA-264 is required. The clad plate shall be  ultrasonically examined in accordance with SA-578 supplementary requirements S7 using  Level 1 acceptance criteria.    4.2 Weld Overlay  Generally speaking (when clad is specified as SS 321 or SS 347, or overlay is specified as   SS 347, on data sheet), the weld overlay is applied using a two-layers technique as follows:  - First layer : 309L SS  - Second layer : 347 SS (type 321SS shall not be permitted)  - Minimum effective thickness of undiluted alloy (after final machining if any) shall be those  required on equipment data sheet specification.  However, single layer weld deposit overlay (type 309LNb as typical) may be used provided  the fabricator can demonstrate to the contractor the use of a qualified and acceptable  procedure.  Note 1: When clad is specified as SS 317L or overlay is specified as SS 317L on data sheet,  the weld overlay is applied using a two-layers technique as follow:  - First layer:  309LMo SS or 309L SS  - Second layer:  317L  (Single layer not allowed)  Note 2: The number of weld layers in production shall not be less than the number of layers  deposited for weld overlay procedure qualification tests.  When required by the Owner/User, a method to evaluate the weld overlay for susceptibility to  hydrogen disbonding shall be agreed to between the Fabricator and Owner/User. In such  case, the Owner/User shall define testing requirements and acceptance criteria. An example  of a standard disbonding test may be found in ASTM G 146.  Welding processes are the same than in  paragraph 3-2,  using strips or wires for SAW  process.  GMAW process is not allowed, except for structural attachments welding on overlay.  FCAW with gas shielding may also be used for some limited location such as overlay on Cr- Mo joint, internal support rings, etc.  Both of GMAW and FCAW processes shall be authorized by the Contractor. As the same  manner, the use of Electroslag (ESW) process remains subject to Contractor’s acceptance.  STANDARD MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS   Réf.  Rév.

Ferrite content is typically determined by the as-deposited chemical composition and the  WRC-diagram.    4.4 Nozzles and Manways  Nozzles and Manways (neck, flange, blind) in clad vessels, or in clad section of vessels, shall  be of the same base material as the vessel and internally clad, or overlaid, with the same  high alloy.  Loose lining, lap-joint flanges, welding of nozzle of different material than the vessel is not  permitted.

POST WELD HEAT TREATMENT  The equipment shall receive PWHT as required by ASME and/or applicable code cases.  Final PWHT modifies the microstructure of the weld metal and of the Heat Affected Zones. It  gives the best metallurgical asset of the weldment.  Unless otherwise specified by steel maker a typical recommended range of temperature  could be 690-720°C – Holding time by reactor manufacturer according to wall thickness and  code and taking into account the anticipated number of heat treatment cycles.  Note: Vessel Manufacturer has the full responsibility of the mechanical behavior of the  vessel. For this reason, PWHT specification shall be optimized and defined by himself (in  accordance with steel Manufacturer) so as to guaranty, at one and the same time,  mechanical and toughness characteristics on the delivered equipment.   Given typical temperature range may accordingly be reconsidered so as to get the fine  balance between strength and toughness..  Intermediate Heat treatments definition is under vessel vendor scope and shall be approved  by Contractor,  - ISR (intermediate stress relieving) uses to reduce the hydrogen content in the welds  and reduces residual stresses in the welded joints as well. The temperature for ISR is  typically led in between 650°C-680°C while holding time will depend on thickness  (min. 2h). Different holding temperature may be accepted when vessel manufacturer  has good fabrication experience. To be approved by Contractor. It is the standard  practice to require ISR for restrained welds such as nozzle attachment welds and  main welds that will not be immediately postweld heat treated.  - DHT (Dehydrogenation Treatment) only uses to reduce the hydrogen content in the  welds to prevent from hydrogen induced cracking. This alternative lower temperature  HT should be addressed on a case-by-case basis considering the low as-welded  toughness of V-modified steels and the induced risks. DHT shall not be allowed  without getting prior approval of the Contractor. This heat treatment is performed at  around 350°C (min.4h) ) thus limiting the Cr carbide precipitation in stainless steel  weld overlay if any. However, if vessel manufacturer has previous experience with  lower temperature and holding time he may propose other conditions supported by  data.  All welding (including potential weld repairs) will be completed before final PWHT excepted  where special care has been taken to avoid necessity of PWHT (buttering with high alloy  deposits).  Note: Local PWHT shall not be permitted. In case of any furnace size limitation, vessel  Manufacturer shall obtain specific derogation from the Contractor to perform local PWHT at  the closing seam of shell.

NON DESTRUCTIVE TESTING BY FABRICATOR  For vessels designed and constructed in accordance with the rules of ASME Section VIII,  Div.1, Inspection Plan and Testing Plan shall be submitted to Engineering (EPC) for  approval.  For vessels designed and constructed in accordance with the rules of ASME Section VIII,  Div.2, non destructive examination (NDE) as a minimum shall comply with the Table AF- 241.1.    6.1 Minimum requirements  Minimum requirements for NDE should typically include the following non-destructive tests :  - Radiographic examination (RT) on all pressure welds (prior to PWHT only, provided  that UT is made before and after PWHT). RT is not so effective after PWHT for detecting  potential cracks. RT is sensitive for volumetric flaw such as slugs inclusion but not  sensitive for shape cracks which could appear during PWHT. Nevertheless, the final  decision, relative to RT examination sequences, belongs to the Contractor  - Use of the TOFD (Time Of Flight Diffraction) techniques in place of RT can be  proposed  by Vendor. Even if permitted by Code case, this shall be submitted to  Owner/Contractor approval  - Ultrasonic examination (UT) for all pressure welds (prior/after PWHT and after  hydrotest),  - Positive Material Identification (PMI) on all alloyed material if any (cladding, overlay,  etc.),  - Mill test report shall be supplied for all materials,  - Magnetic Particles Examination (MT) after PWHT,  - Dye penetrant examination (PT) of all weld overlay surfaces after PWHT.  Note: If Vendor can duly establish that weld-overlay has been performed continuously, thus  guarantying that no change in welding conditions has been encountered while depositing on  vessel shell, then PT could be performed on some representative w/o width lines only.  Procedure’s acceptance shall be submitted to Owner/Contractor decision. Whatever the  approved procedure will be, 100% complementary visual inspection always remains  mandatory.  - Hardness measurement.  - In case of cladding and/or overlay, Ferrite checking (magnetic ferriscope) in addition  to ferrite evaluation based upon sampling and chemical analysis.

IN-MOD.dot / Rév. 5 du 19.03.2010  IN-42.3-5.1 Std material spec Low alloyed steels for pressure vessels.doc  GENERAL COMMENTS    The information given hereafter for \"Base Metal Quality\" and \"Welding\" results from  AXENS/IFP wide and significant experience in the low alloyed steels made pressure vessels  specification/operation and mostly in the field of hydro-processing and reforming units.  Specific codes, as well as Client and Engineering Contractor Standards may also influence  the choice in materials and methods. Therefore, the given specifications shall be considered  as minimum requirements and should consequently be used by the Engineering Contractor  during call-for-bid.  The data given here, are defined in the aim at giving an appropriated quality and safety level  for these critical equipments. It should not in any case interfere with Contractor’s  specification relative to design, manufacturing and inspection of the equipment. In case of  any discrepancy between specifications, and for lack of any official derogating decision  issued by the Owner or the Contractor, then the more stringent requirement shall govern.      PREAMBLE:    The use of V-modified Cr-Mo steels is, for many years, considered as an enhancing  specification compared to corresponding conventional Cr-Mo steels.   Beyond the well-known improvement of design stress intensity resulting in thinner and lighter  reactors, they also offer an increased resistance to hydrogen damages, a lower susceptibility  to temper embrittlement and also a better resistance to weld overlay disbonding and creep  phenomena.  Fine, globular shape, stable and well distributed Vanadium carbides do favorably act in  providing excellent benefits to these steels.  Nevertheless, this steel grade should never be specified without considering its inherent  weakness in term of limited toughness and reduced weldability which require specific and  dedicated manufacturing and heat treatment procedures. Vendor should then be able to  establish its capability and its similar experience by demonstrating how dedicated  carefulness is applied all along fabrication steps.   Moreover, vendor shall typically assure a close cooperation with the steel supplier itself so as  to finally get the fine balance between the different specifications herein given.

Nevertheless, basic oxygen furnace process with heated ladle refining and vacuum  degassing may also be considered as acceptable,  All plates shall be thermally treated either by annealing, normalizing-and-tempering, or, when  permitted by the purchaser, accelerated cooling from the austenitizing temperature by air  blasting or liquid quenching, followed by tempering,  Heat treatments holding time shall be sufficient to obtain an uniform temperature throughout  the plate,  The tempering temperature shall be adapted so as to give the required mechanical  properties after post-weld heat treatment. It shall consequently be noted that, depending on  cases, the Minimum temperature of Tempering may sometimes be higher than the one  defined for the final Post-Weld Heat Treatment of the equipment.    2.1.2 Chemical analysis  Applications for which V-modified grade is specified will typically be operated at high  temperature (i.e. above 350°C). As a consequence, potential metallurgical embrittling  phenomena shall be properly anticipated during design and manufacturing phases.  Countermeasures including specific chemical analysis given here-below shall consequently  be considered and that whatever the values specified by the construction codes.

IN-MOD.dot / Rév. 5 du 19.03.2010  IN-42.3-5.1 Std material spec Low alloyed steels for pressure vessels.doc  In view of minimizing the risk of temper embrittlement, the \"J\" factor shall verify the relation  hereafter :    J lower than 100 (target 80)  with J = (Si + Mn) * (P + Sn) * 104      All elements mentioned here above, specified in weight percentages, have to be checked on  ladle and on product.     Notes:   - Susceptibility to Temper Embrittlement phenomenon has forced steel producers to restrict  tramp elements contents, mainly P, Sb, Sn, As (in order of decreasing severity in weight  percent basis) which elements can detrimentally diffuse to the grain boundaries while steel is  held within the embrittling temperature range.   This criterion and also the specified impurities level shall uniformly be guarantied for the  whole vessel, including the shell, heads and all other plates made pressure retaining parts as  well (e.g. nozzle parts, elbows, etc.).    2.1.3 Mechanical properties  2.1.3.1 Test specimens  As per code requirements SA20 / SA370 unless otherwise specified by the project  For wall thicknesses above or equal to 50mm, location of the Test specimens shall be in  accordance with section 5.5.1.1 of API 934,  The impact tests shall be carried out after heat treatments simulating those anticipated along  the fabrication that is post-forming heat treatment and intermediate HT, if any, and also final  PWHT  The Mechanical tests shall be carried out after heat treatments simulating those anticipated  along the fabrication that is post-forming heat treatment, intermediate HT, if any, and final  PWHT plus additional heat treatments to anticipate potential repair (number to be defined by  Contractor/Owner).  All tensile, impact, temper embrittlement and hardness testing on heat affected zones (HAZ)  shall be carried out on samples from production weld test plates.

IN-MOD.dot / Rév. 5 du 19.03.2010  IN-42.3-5.1 Std material spec Low alloyed steels for pressure vessels.doc  2.1.3.2 Tensile properties  Tensile tests shall be carried out at room temperature for both ends of each plate (Tensile  tests at design temperature may be requested for information, depending on the Contractor  specification).  Room temperature tensile properties shall meet the requirements of the material standard.  Yield strength at design temperature shall meet the value taken into account in calculation  notes (Ultimate Tensile Strength will be given for information).  Note: For Creep range calculation, Yield and Ultimate Strength may be given for information  at the Owner/EPC discretion.    2.1.3.3 Impact test properties  Charpy V-Notch impact testing is required for all pressure retaining components, welds and  heat affected zones (HAZ).  The average of three impact test values at testing temperature shall not be less than 55J  (40ft.lb) without individual value below 47J (35ft.lb).  Testing temperature shall be the lower of the Minimum Design Metal Temperature (MDMT)  and -18°C (0°F).  Note: One shall note that sulfur does act on resilience properties and sulfur content shall  consequently be kept as low as possible to obtain high CVN energy.    2.1.3.4 Step cooling treatment  Axens uses to consider that the step cooling treatment should only be mandatory for  equipments for which the operating temperature is above 350°C which should typically be  the case for the present steel grade. Final decision to be given by Contractor/Owner  In the aim at assessing the Temper Embrittlement detrimental effect on plates, forgings and  welding, transition curves (Impact energy versus Temperature) has to be plotted before and  after step cooling test. Test specimen status definition, and step cooling procedure as well,  have to be submitted to Contractor/Owner approval.  Unless otherwise specified by client or detail engineering, the Step Cooling Treatment shall  be carried out on the thickest plate issued from the Heat showing the highest J factor.  The said Treatment will also be carried out on the thickest Plates issued from Heats showing  J factor higher than 80 or P + Sn > 0.012%, if any.  Each qualified welding procedure shall also be submitted to Step cooling test. Transition  curves shall be obtained for the deposited Welding Metal and Heat Affected Zones as well.  Note: Vendor may propose, based on its own experience, to reduce the number of test  coupons by focusing onto the welding procedures which are considered as being the more  detrimental ones regarding the expected embrittlement.

The increase in transition temperature (TT55) from its original value  has become an accepted tool for the determination of temper embrittlement susceptibility. In  order to characterize a material for temper embrittlement resistance, a relationship was  developed using the original or “as fabricated” TT55 and the increase in TT55 (delta TT55).  After step cooling heat treatment, for impact properties (Charpy-V at ¼ T and ½ T material  thickness) should meet the following requirements:    TT55 + 2.5 delta TT55 lower than or equal to 10°C    Where TT55 is the 55 Joules transition temperature   and delta TT55 is (TT55 [step cooled] - TT55 [original value])    Note: Major steel vendors use to propose step-cooling treatment surrendering, for base  material, based on their know-how and demonstrated experiences provided that the specified  impact test energy criterion is verified at temperature of -60°C or below while measured J  factor is below 100. It is assumed that the available extra-clean steels shall allow obtaining  such high resilience and CVN-Energy levels.   Even if final decision remain at the Owner/Contractor discretion for base material, one shall  note that all Welding Qualification must undergo dedicated Step Cooling test (CVN impact  energy obtained from product coupons will have to be in accordance with the one obtained  during Qualification phase).     2.1.3.5 Hardness properties  The material hardness shall not exceed 235 HB.    2.1.3.6 Responsibility for Base material Tests  Mechanical tests may be performed by the base materials Manufacturer or the reactor  Manufacturer. The Mechanical Tests shall allow ensuring that the minimum mechanical  properties required will be met after all anticipated heat treatments of the reactor during and  after fabrication.

WELDING  3.1 General  The vessel Manufacturer shall not subcontract fabrication involving welding to others without  the written approval of the Contractor.  The plate, or forging edge preparation for welding as well as the nozzle openings will be  carried out by machining. Flame cutting may sometimes be allowed by the Contractor  provided the heat affected zone is completely removed by machining or grinding (ex: Nozzles  openings in shell or head).    3.2 Welding processes  - SAW : Submerged Arc Welding  The Manufacturer and brand name or grade of all welding consumables shall be  specified in the welding procedure and submitted to the Contractor for approval.  - SMAW : Shielded Manual Arc Welding  Only low hydrogen electrodes shall be used (refer to ASME II Part C SFA 5.5).

Notes:   - All the pressure retaining welds in hydrogen service , including the internals welded  on pressure parts, have to be full penetration type. If this is not possible, there will be a vent  drill-hole of the not welded area. External attachments are not concerned  - Only approved WPS with WPQR are to be used for fabrication. Welding procedures  submitted to the contractor shall include details variables and welding parameters for each  used welding process. Qualification test shall be made using filler metal, flux and / or inert  gases of same type, brand, chemistry and size as the ones to be used on work.  - Coupons to be used for Qualification test shall be heat treated in the same manner as  specified for the plate test as given in 2.1.3.

Cladding shall be 3mm minimum thickness SA-240 or as specified on the drawings. A  140Mpa minimum shear strength per SA-264 is required. The clad plate shall be  ultrasonically examined in accordance with SA-578 supplementary requirements S7 using  Level 1 acceptance criteria.    4.2 Weld Overlay  Generally speaking (when clad is specified as SS 321 or SS 347, or overlay is specified as   SS 347, on data sheet), the weld overlay is applied using a two-layers technique as follows:  - First layer : 309L SS  - Second layer : 347 SS (type 321SS shall not be permitted)  - Minimum effective thickness of undiluted alloy (after final machining if any) shall be those  required on equipment data sheet specification.  However, single layer weld deposit overlay (type 309LNb as typical) may be used provided  the fabricator can demonstrate to the contractor the use of a qualified and acceptable  procedure.  Note 1: When clad is specified as SS 317L or overlay is specified as SS 317L on data sheet,  the weld overlay is applied using a two-layers technique as follow:  - First layer:  309LMo SS or 309L SS  - Second layer:  317L  (Single layer not allowed)  Note 2: The number of weld layers in production shall not be less than the number of layers  deposited for weld overlay procedure qualification tests.  When required by the Owner/User, a method to evaluate the weld overlay for susceptibility to  hydrogen disbonding shall be agreed to between the Fabricator and Owner/User. In such  case, the Owner/User shall define testing requirements and acceptance criteria. An example  of a standard disbonding test may be found in ASTM G 146.  Welding processes are the same than in  paragraph 3-2,  using strips or wires for SAW  process.  GMAW process is not allowed, except for structural attachments welding on overlay.  FCAW with gas shielding may also be used for some limited location such as overlay on Cr- Mo joint, internal support rings, etc.  Both of GMAW and FCAW processes shall be authorized by the Contractor. As the same  manner, the use of Electroslag (ESW) process remains subject to Contractor’s acceptance.  STANDARD MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS   Réf.  Rév.

POST WELD HEAT TREATMENT  The equipment shall receive PWHT as required by ASME and/or applicable code cases.  Final PWHT modifies the microstructure of the weld metal and of the Heat Affected Zones. It  gives the best metallurgical asset of the weldment.  Unless otherwise specified by steel maker a typical recommended range of temperature  could be 690-720°C – Holding time by reactor manufacturer according to wall thickness and  code and taking into account the anticipated number of heat treatment cycles.  Note: Vessel Manufacturer has the full responsibility of the mechanical behavior of the  vessel. For this reason, PWHT specification shall be optimized and defined by himself (in  accordance with steel Manufacturer) so as to guaranty, at one and the same time,  mechanical and toughness characteristics on the delivered equipment.   Given typical temperature range may accordingly be reconsidered so as to get the fine  balance between strength and toughness..  Intermediate Heat treatments definition is under vessel vendor scope and shall be approved  by Contractor,  - ISR (intermediate stress relieving) uses to reduce the hydrogen content in the welds  and reduces residual stresses in the welded joints as well. The temperature for ISR is  typically led in between 650°C-680°C while holding time will depend on thickness  (min. 2h). Different holding temperature may be accepted when vessel manufacturer  has good fabrication experience. To be approved by Contractor. It is the standard  practice to require ISR for restrained welds such as nozzle attachment welds and  main welds that will not be immediately postweld heat treated.  - DHT (Dehydrogenation Treatment) only uses to reduce the hydrogen content in the  welds to prevent from hydrogen induced cracking. This alternative lower temperature  HT should be addressed on a case-by-case basis considering the low as-welded  toughness of V-modified steels and the induced risks. DHT shall not be allowed  without getting prior approval of the Contractor. This heat treatment is performed at  around 350°C (min.4h) ) thus limiting the Cr carbide precipitation in stainless steel  weld overlay if any. However, if vessel manufacturer has previous experience with  lower temperature and holding time he may propose other conditions supported by  data.  All welding (including potential weld repairs) will be completed before final PWHT excepted  where special care has been taken to avoid necessity of PWHT (buttering with high alloy  deposits).  Note: Local PWHT shall not be permitted. In case of any furnace size limitation, vessel  Manufacturer shall obtain specific derogation from the Contractor to perform local PWHT at  the closing seam of shell.

NON DESTRUCTIVE TESTING BY FABRICATOR  For vessels designed and constructed in accordance with the rules of ASME Section VIII,  Div.1, Inspection Plan and Testing Plan shall be submitted to Engineering (EPC) for  approval.  For vessels designed and constructed in accordance with the rules of ASME Section VIII,  Div.2, non destructive examination (NDE) as a minimum shall comply with the Table AF- 241.1.    6.1 Minimum requirements  Minimum requirements for NDE should typically include the following non-destructive tests :  - Radiographic examination (RT) on all pressure welds (prior to PWHT only, provided  that UT is made before and after PWHT). RT is not so effective after PWHT for detecting  potential cracks. RT is sensitive for volumetric flaw such as slugs inclusion but not  sensitive for shape cracks which could appear during PWHT. Nevertheless, the final  decision, relative to RT examination sequences, belongs to the Contractor  - Use of the TOFD (Time Of Flight Diffraction) techniques in place of RT can be  proposed  by Vendor. Even if permitted by Code case, this shall be submitted to  Owner/Contractor approval  - Ultrasonic examination (UT) for all pressure welds (prior/after PWHT and after  hydrotest),  - Positive Material Identification (PMI) on all alloyed material if any (cladding, overlay,  etc.),  - Mill test report shall be supplied for all materials,  - Magnetic Particles Examination (MT) after PWHT,  - Dye penetrant examination (PT) of all weld overlay surfaces after PWHT.  Note: If Vendor can duly establish that weld-overlay has been performed continuously, thus  guarantying that no change in welding conditions has been encountered while depositing on  vessel shell, then PT could be performed on some representative w/o width lines only.  Procedure’s acceptance shall be submitted to Owner/Contractor decision. Whatever the  approved procedure will be, 100% complementary visual inspection always remains  mandatory.  - Hardness measurement.  - In case of cladding and/or overlay, Ferrite checking (magnetic ferriscope) in addition  to ferrite evaluation based upon sampling and chemical analysis. Acceptance criteria  of ferrite content by magnetic ferriscope shall be 3% to 10%. Magnetic instrument  shall be calibrated and certified per AWS A4-2.  STANDARD MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS   Réf.  Rév.

The increase in transition temperature (TT55) from its original value has become an accepted tool for the determination of temper embrittlement susceptibility. In order to characterize a material for temper embrittlement resistance, a relationship was developed using the original or “as fabricated” TT55 and the increase in TT55 (delta TT55). After step cooling heat treatment, for impact properties (Charpy-V at ¼ T and ½ T material thickness) should meet the following requirements: TT55 + 2.5 delta TT55 lower than or equal to 10°C Where TT55 is the 55 Joules transition temperature and delta TT55 is (TT55 [step cooled] - TT55 [original value]) Note: Major steel vendors use to propose step-cooling treatment surrendering, for base material, based on their know-how and demonstrated experiences provided that the specified impact test energy criterion is verified at temperature of -60°C or below while measured J factor is below 100. It is assumed that the available extra-clean steels shall allow obtaining such high resilience and CVN-Energy levels. Even if final decision remain at the Owner/Contractor discretion for base material, one shall note that all Welding Qualification must undergo dedicated Step Cooling test (CVN impact energy obtained from product coupons will have to be in accordance with the one obtained during Qualification phase).\",\"Step cooling requirement\")]})]"

The average of three impact test values at testing temperature shall not be less than 55J  (40ft.lb) without individual value below 47J (35ft.lb).  Testing temperature shall be the lower of the Minimum Design Metal Temperature (MDMT)  and -30°C(-22°F).  Note: One shall note that sulfur does act on resilience properties and sulfur content shall  consequently be kept as low as possible to obtain high CVN energy.    2.1.3.4 Step cooling treatment  (Equipment to be operated above 350°C)  Axens uses to consider that the step cooling treatment should only be mandatory for  equipments for which the operating temperature is above 350°C. Final decision to be given  by Contractor/Owner.  In the aim at assessing the Temper Embrittlement detrimental effect on plates, forgings and  welding, transition curves (Impact energy versus Temperature) has to be plotted before and  after step cooling test. Test specimen status definition, and step cooling procedure as well,  have to be submitted to Contractor/Owner approval.  Unless otherwise specified by client or detail engineering, the Step Cooling Treatment shall  be carried out on the thickest plate issued from the Heat showing the highest J factor.  The said Treatment will also be carried out on the thickest Plates issued from Heats showing  J factor higher than 80 or P + Sn > 0.012%, if any.  Each qualified welding procedure shall also be submitted to Step cooling test. Transition  curves shall be obtained for the deposited Welding Metal and Heat Affected Zones as well.    Note: Vendor may propose, based on its own experience, to reduce the number of test  coupons by focusing onto the welding procedures which are considered as being the more  detrimental ones regarding the expected embrittlement. Final decision remains at  Contractor/Owner discretion     For information only, a typical step cooling sequence could be:  Heat to 595°C Hold for 1 hour, cool at 6°C/h max. to 540°C  Heat to 540°C Hold for 15 hours, cool at 6°C/h max. to 525°C  Heat to 525°C Hold for 24 hours, cool at 6°C/h max. to 495°C  Heat to 495°C Hold for 60 hours, cool at 3°C/h max. to 470°C  Heat to 470°C Hold for 100 hours, cool at 28°C/h max. at 315°C and then air cooling    STANDARD MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS   Réf.

The increase in transition temperature (TT55) from its original value  has become an accepted tool for the determination of temper embrittlement susceptibility. In  order to characterize a material for temper embrittlement resistance, a relationship was  developed using the original or “as fabricated” TT55 and the increase in TT55 (delta TT55).  After step cooling heat treatment, for impact properties (Charpy-V at ¼ T and ½ T material  thickness) should meet the following requirements:    TT55 + 2.5 delta TT55 lower than or equal to 10°C    Where :   TT55 is the 55 Joules transition temperature  and delta TT55 is (TT55 [step cooled] - TT55 [original value])    Note: Major steel vendors use to propose step-cooling treatment surrendering, for base  material, based on their know-how and demonstrated experiences provided that the specified  impact test energy criterion is verified at temperature of -60°C or below while measured J  factor is below 100. It is assumed that the available extra-clean steels shall allow obtaining  such high resilience and CVN-Energy levels.   Even if final decision remains at the Owner/Contractor discretion for base material, one shall  note that all Welding Qualification must undergo dedicated Step Cooling test (CVN impact  energy obtained from product coupons will have to be in accordance with the one obtained  during Qualification phase).     2.1.3.5 Hardness properties  The material hardness shall not exceed 225 HB.    2.1.3.6 Responsibility for Base material Tests  Mechanical tests may be performed by the base material’s Manufacturer or the vessel  Manufacturer.

If this is not possible, there will be a  vent drill-hole of the not welded area. External attachments are not concerned  -  Only approved WPS with WPQR are to be used for fabrication. Welding procedures  submitted to the Contractor shall include details variables and welding parameters for  each used welding process. Qualification test shall be made using filler metal, flux  and / or inert gases of same type, brand, chemistry and size as the ones to be used  on work.  -  Coupons to be used for Qualification test shall be heat treated in the same manner as  specified for the plate test as given in 2.1.3.

CLADDING OR WELD OVERLAY  4.1 Cladding  High-Alloy clad materials shall be in accordance with the ASME Section II, Part A,  Specification SA-264 for Chromium-Nickel Steels.  Cladding shall be 3mm minimum thickness SA-240 or as specified on the drawings. A  140MPa minimum shear strength per SA-264 is required. The clad plate shall be  ultrasonically examined in accordance with SA-578 supplementary requirements S7 using  Level 1 acceptance criteria.  4.2 Weld Overlay  Generally speaking (when clad is specified as SS 321 or SS 347, or overlay is specified as  SS 347, on data sheet), the weld overlay is applied using a two-layers technique as follows:  - First layer : 309L SS  - Second layer : 347 SS (type 321SS shall not be permitted)  - Minimum effective thickness of undiluted alloy (after final machining if any) shall be  those required on equipment data sheet specification   However, single layer weld deposit overlay (type 309LNb as typical) may be used  provided the fabricator can demonstrate to the Contractor the use of a qualified and  acceptable procedure.  Note 1: When clad is specified as SS 317L or overlay is specified as SS 317L on data sheet,  the weld overlay is applied using a two-layers technique as follow:  - First layer: 309LMo SS or 309L SS  - Second layer: 317L (Single layer not allowed)  Note 2: The number of weld layers in production shall not be less than the number of layers  deposited for weld overlay procedure qualification tests.  When required by the Owner/User, a method to evaluate the weld overlay for susceptibility to  hydrogen disbonding shall be agreed between the Fabricator and Owner/User. In such a  case, the Owner/User shall define testing requirements and acceptance criteria. An example  of a standard disbonding test may be found in ASTM G 146.  Welding processes are the same than in paragraph 3-2, using strips or wires for SAW  process.  GMAW process is not allowed, except for structural attachments welding on overlay.  FCAW with gas shielding may also be used for some limited location such as overlay on Cr- Mo joint, internal support rings, etc.  Both of GMAW and FCAW processes shall be authorized by the Contractor. As the same  manner, the use of Electroslag (ESW) process remains subject to Contractor’s acceptance.    STANDARD MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS   Réf.  Rév.

POST WELD HEAT TREATMENT  (BY VESSEL FABRICATOR)  The equipment shall receive PWHT as required by ASME and/or applicable Code Cases.  Final PWHT modifies the microstructure of the weld metal and of the Heat Affected Zones. It  gives the best metallurgical asset of the weldment.  Unless otherwise specified by steel maker a typical recommended range of temperature  could be 677°C-703°C. Holding time by reactor manufacturer according to wall thickness and  code and taking into account the anticipated number of heat treatment cycles.    Note: Vessel Manufacturer has the full responsibility of the mechanical behavior of the  vessel. For this reason, PWHT specification shall be optimized and defined by himself (in  accordance with steel Manufacturer) so as to guaranty, at one and the same time,  mechanical and toughness characteristics on the delivered equipment. Given typical  temperature range may accordingly be reconsidered so as to get the fine balance between  strength and toughness.  Intermediate heat treatments definition is under vessel vendor scope and shall be approved  by the Contractor:  - ISR (Intermediate Stress Relieving) uses to reduce the hydrogen content in the welds  and reduces residual stresses in the welded joints as well. The temperature for ISR is  typically led in between 590°C-600°C while holding time will depend on thickness  (min. 2h). Different holding temperature may be accepted when vessel manufacturer  has good fabrication experience. To be approved by Contractor. It is the standard  practice to require ISR for restrained welds such as nozzle attachment welds and  main welds that will not be immediately postweld heat treated (especially for thick  shell, head and nozzles joints).  - DHT (Dehydrogenation Treatment) only uses to reduce the hydrogen content in the  welds to prevent from hydrogen induced cracking. This alternative lower temperature  HT may be allowed only upon approval of the Contractor. This heat treatment is  performed at around 300°C (min.1h) thus limiting the Cr carbide precipitation in  stainless steel weld overlay if any.  All welding (including potential weld repairs) will be completed before final PWHT excepted  where special care has been taken to avoid necessity of PWHT (buttering with high alloy  deposits).    Note: Local PWHT shall not be permitted. In case of any furnace size limitation, vessel  Manufacturer shall obtain specific derogation from the Contractor/Owner to perform local  PWHT at the closing seam of shell.

NON DESTRUCTIVE TESTING BY FABRICATOR  For vessels designed and constructed in accordance with the rules of ASME Section VIII,  Div.1, Inspection Plan and Testing Plan shall be submitted to Engineering (EPC) for  approval.  For vessels designed and constructed in accordance with the rules of ASME Section VIII,  Div.2, non destructive examination (NDE) as a minimum shall comply with the Table AF- 241.1.    6.1 Minimum requirements  Minimum requirements for NDE should typically include the following non-destructive tests:  - Radiographic examination (RT) on all pressure welds (prior to PWHT only, provided that UT  is made before and after PWHT). RT is not so effective after PWHT for detecting potential  cracks. RT is sensitive for volumetric flaw such as slugs inclusion but not sensitive for  shape cracks which could appear during PWHT. Nevertheless, the final decision, relative to  RT examination sequences, belongs to the Contractor,  - Use of the TOFD (Time Of Flight Diffraction) techniques in place of RT can be proposed by  Vendor. Even if permitted by Code case, this shall be submitted to Owner/Contractor  approval,  - Ultrasonic examination (UT) for all pressure welds (prior/after PWHT and after hydrotest),  - Positive Material Identification (PMI) on all alloyed material if any (cladding, overlay, etc.),  - Mill test report shall be supplied for all materials,  - Magnetic Particles Examination (MT) after PWHT,  - Dye penetrant examination (PT) of all weld overlay surfaces after PWHT.    Note: If Vendor can duly establish that weld-overlay has been performed continuously, thus  guarantying that no change in welding conditions has been encountered while depositing on  vessel shell, then PT could be performed on some representative w/o width lines only.  Procedure’s acceptance shall be submitted to Owner/Contractor decision. Whatever the  approved procedure will be, 100% complementary visual inspection always remains  mandatory.  - Hardness measurement.  - In case of cladding and/or overlay, Ferrite checking (magnetic ferriscope) in addition  to ferrite evaluation based upon sampling and chemical analysis. Acceptance criteria  of ferrite content by magnetic ferriscope shall be 3% to 10%. Magnetic instrument  shall be calibrated and certified per AWS A4-2.    STANDARD MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS   Réf.

Testing temperature shall be the lower of the Minimum Design Metal Temperature (MDMT)  and -30°C(-22°F).  Note: One shall note that sulfur does act on resilience properties and sulfur content shall  consequently be kept as low as possible to obtain high CVN energy.    2.1.3.4 Step cooling treatment  (Equipment to be operated above 350°C)  Axens uses to consider that the step cooling treatment should only be mandatory for  equipments for which the operating temperature is above 350°C. Final decision to be given  by Contractor/Owner.  In the aim at assessing the Temper Embrittlement detrimental effect on plates, forgings and  welding, transition curves (Impact energy versus Temperature) has to be plotted before and  after step cooling test. Test specimen status definition, and step cooling procedure as well,  have to be submitted to Contractor/Owner approval.  Unless otherwise specified by client or detail engineering, the Step Cooling Treatment shall  be carried out on the thickest plate issued from the Heat showing the highest J factor.  The said Treatment will also be carried out on the thickest Plates issued from Heats showing  J factor higher than 80 or P + Sn > 0.012%, if any.  Each qualified welding procedure shall also be submitted to Step cooling test. Transition  curves shall be obtained for the deposited Welding Metal and Heat Affected Zones as well.

IN-MOD.dot / Rév. 5 du 19.03.2010  IN-42.2-5.1 Std material spec Low alloyed steels for pressure vessels.doc  This simulated isothermal embrittlement results in a certain increase (shift) of the material’s  transition temperature. The increase in transition temperature (TT55) from its original value  has become an accepted tool for the determination of temper embrittlement susceptibility. In  order to characterize a material for temper embrittlement resistance, a relationship was  developed using the original or “as fabricated” TT55 and the increase in TT55 (delta TT55).  After step cooling heat treatment, for impact properties (Charpy-V at ¼ T and ½ T material  thickness) should meet the following requirements:    TT55 + 2.5 delta TT55 lower than or equal to 10°C    Where :   TT55 is the 55 Joules transition temperature  and delta TT55 is (TT55 [step cooled] - TT55 [original value])    Note: Major steel vendors use to propose step-cooling treatment surrendering, for base  material, based on their know-how and demonstrated experiences provided that the specified  impact test energy criterion is verified at temperature of -60°C or below while measured J  factor is below 100. It is assumed that the available extra-clean steels shall allow obtaining  such high resilience and CVN-Energy levels.   Even if final decision remains at the Owner/Contractor discretion for base material, one shall  note that all Welding Qualification must undergo dedicated Step Cooling test (CVN impact  energy obtained from product coupons will have to be in accordance with the one obtained  during Qualification phase).     2.1.3.5 Hardness properties  The material hardness shall not exceed 225 HB.    2.1.3.6 Responsibility for Base material Tests  Mechanical tests may be performed by the base material’s Manufacturer or the vessel  Manufacturer.

Notes:   -  All the pressure retaining welds in hydrogen service, including the internals welded on  pressure parts, have to be full penetration type. If this is not possible, there will be a  vent drill-hole of the not welded area. External attachments are not concerned  -  Only approved WPS with WPQR are to be used for fabrication. Welding procedures  submitted to the Contractor shall include details variables and welding parameters for  each used welding process. Qualification test shall be made using filler metal, flux  and / or inert gases of same type, brand, chemistry and size as the ones to be used  on work.  -  Coupons to be used for Qualification test shall be heat treated in the same manner as  specified for the plate test as given in 2.1.3.

CLADDING OR WELD OVERLAY  4.1 Cladding  High-Alloy clad materials shall be in accordance with the ASME Section II, Part A,  Specification SA-264 for Chromium-Nickel Steels.  Cladding shall be 3mm minimum thickness SA-240 or as specified on the drawings. A  140MPa minimum shear strength per SA-264 is required. The clad plate shall be  ultrasonically examined in accordance with SA-578 supplementary requirements S7 using  Level 1 acceptance criteria.  4.2 Weld Overlay  Generally speaking (when clad is specified as SS 321 or SS 347, or overlay is specified as  SS 347, on data sheet), the weld overlay is applied using a two-layers technique as follows:  - First layer : 309L SS  - Second layer : 347 SS (type 321SS shall not be permitted)  - Minimum effective thickness of undiluted alloy (after final machining if any) shall be  those required on equipment data sheet specification   However, single layer weld deposit overlay (type 309LNb as typical) may be used  provided the fabricator can demonstrate to the Contractor the use of a qualified and  acceptable procedure.  Note 1: When clad is specified as SS 317L or overlay is specified as SS 317L on data sheet,  the weld overlay is applied using a two-layers technique as follow:  - First layer: 309LMo SS or 309L SS  - Second layer: 317L (Single layer not allowed)  Note 2: The number of weld layers in production shall not be less than the number of layers  deposited for weld overlay procedure qualification tests.  When required by the Owner/User, a method to evaluate the weld overlay for susceptibility to  hydrogen disbonding shall be agreed between the Fabricator and Owner/User. In such a  case, the Owner/User shall define testing requirements and acceptance criteria. An example  of a standard disbonding test may be found in ASTM G 146.  Welding processes are the same than in paragraph 3-2, using strips or wires for SAW  process.  GMAW process is not allowed, except for structural attachments welding on overlay.  FCAW with gas shielding may also be used for some limited location such as overlay on Cr- Mo joint, internal support rings, etc.  Both of GMAW and FCAW processes shall be authorized by the Contractor. As the same  manner, the use of Electroslag (ESW) process remains subject to Contractor’s acceptance.    STANDARD MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS   Réf.  Rév.

POST WELD HEAT TREATMENT  (BY VESSEL FABRICATOR)  The equipment shall receive PWHT as required by ASME and/or applicable Code Cases.  Final PWHT modifies the microstructure of the weld metal and of the Heat Affected Zones. It  gives the best metallurgical asset of the weldment.  Unless otherwise specified by steel maker a typical recommended range of temperature  could be 677°C-703°C. Holding time by reactor manufacturer according to wall thickness and  code and taking into account the anticipated number of heat treatment cycles.    Note: Vessel Manufacturer has the full responsibility of the mechanical behavior of the  vessel. For this reason, PWHT specification shall be optimized and defined by himself (in  accordance with steel Manufacturer) so as to guaranty, at one and the same time,  mechanical and toughness characteristics on the delivered equipment. Given typical  temperature range may accordingly be reconsidered so as to get the fine balance between  strength and toughness.  Intermediate heat treatments definition is under vessel vendor scope and shall be approved  by the Contractor:  - ISR (Intermediate Stress Relieving) uses to reduce the hydrogen content in the welds  and reduces residual stresses in the welded joints as well. The temperature for ISR is  typically led in between 590°C-600°C while holding time will depend on thickness  (min. 2h). Different holding temperature may be accepted when vessel manufacturer  has good fabrication experience. To be approved by Contractor. It is the standard  practice to require ISR for restrained welds such as nozzle attachment welds and  main welds that will not be immediately postweld heat treated (especially for thick  shell, head and nozzles joints).  - DHT (Dehydrogenation Treatment) only uses to reduce the hydrogen content in the  welds to prevent from hydrogen induced cracking. This alternative lower temperature  HT may be allowed only upon approval of the Contractor. This heat treatment is  performed at around 300°C (min.1h) thus limiting the Cr carbide precipitation in  stainless steel weld overlay if any.  All welding (including potential weld repairs) will be completed before final PWHT excepted  where special care has been taken to avoid necessity of PWHT (buttering with high alloy  deposits).    Note: Local PWHT shall not be permitted. In case of any furnace size limitation, vessel  Manufacturer shall obtain specific derogation from the Contractor/Owner to perform local  PWHT at the closing seam of shell.

NON DESTRUCTIVE TESTING BY FABRICATOR  For vessels designed and constructed in accordance with the rules of ASME Section VIII,  Div.1, Inspection Plan and Testing Plan shall be submitted to Engineering (EPC) for  approval.  For vessels designed and constructed in accordance with the rules of ASME Section VIII,  Div.2, non destructive examination (NDE) as a minimum shall comply with the Table AF- 241.1.    6.1 Minimum requirements  Minimum requirements for NDE should typically include the following non-destructive tests:  - Radiographic examination (RT) on all pressure welds (prior to PWHT only, provided that UT  is made before and after PWHT). RT is not so effective after PWHT for detecting potential  cracks. RT is sensitive for volumetric flaw such as slugs inclusion but not sensitive for  shape cracks which could appear during PWHT. Nevertheless, the final decision, relative to  RT examination sequences, belongs to the Contractor,  - Use of the TOFD (Time Of Flight Diffraction) techniques in place of RT can be proposed by  Vendor. Even if permitted by Code case, this shall be submitted to Owner/Contractor  approval,  - Ultrasonic examination (UT) for all pressure welds (prior/after PWHT and after hydrotest),  - Positive Material Identification (PMI) on all alloyed material if any (cladding, overlay, etc.),  - Mill test report shall be supplied for all materials,  - Magnetic Particles Examination (MT) after PWHT,  - Dye penetrant examination (PT) of all weld overlay surfaces after PWHT.    Note: If Vendor can duly establish that weld-overlay has been performed continuously, thus  guarantying that no change in welding conditions has been encountered while depositing on  vessel shell, then PT could be performed on some representative w/o width lines only.  Procedure’s acceptance shall be submitted to Owner/Contractor decision. Whatever the  approved procedure will be, 100% complementary visual inspection always remains  mandatory.  - Hardness measurement.  - In case of cladding and/or overlay, Ferrite checking (magnetic ferriscope) in addition  to ferrite evaluation based upon sampling and chemical analysis. Acceptance criteria  of ferrite content by magnetic ferriscope shall be 3% to 10%. Magnetic instrument  shall be calibrated and certified per AWS A4-2.    STANDARD MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS   Réf.

IN-MOD.dot / Rév. 5 du 19.03.2010  IN-42.3-5.1 Std material spec Low alloyed steels for pressure vessels.doc  GENERAL COMMENTS    The information given hereafter for \"Base Metal Quality\" and \"Welding\" results from  AXENS/IFP wide and significant experience in the low alloyed steels made pressure vessels  specification/operation and mostly in the field of hydro-processing and reforming units.  Specific codes, as well as Client and Engineering Contractor Standards may also influence  the choice in materials and methods. Therefore, the given specifications shall be considered  as minimum requirements and should consequently be used by the Engineering Contractor  during call-for-bid.  The data given here, are defined in the aim at giving an appropriated quality and safety level  for these critical equipments. It should not in any case interfere with Contractor’s  specification relative to design, manufacturing and inspection of the equipment. In case of  any discrepancy between specifications, and for lack of any official derogating decision  issued by the Owner or the Contractor, then the more stringent requirement shall govern.      PREAMBLE:    The use of V-modified Cr-Mo steels is, for many years, considered as an enhancing  specification compared to corresponding conventional Cr-Mo steels.   Beyond the well-known improvement of design stress intensity resulting in thinner and lighter  reactors, they also offer an increased resistance to hydrogen damages, a lower susceptibility  to temper embrittlement and also a better resistance to weld overlay disbonding and creep  phenomena.  Fine, globular shape, stable and well distributed Vanadium carbides do favorably act in  providing excellent benefits to these steels.  Nevertheless, this steel grade should never be specified without considering its inherent  weakness in term of limited toughness and reduced weldability which require specific and  dedicated manufacturing and heat treatment procedures. Vendor should then be able to  establish its capability and its similar experience by demonstrating how dedicated  carefulness is applied all along fabrication steps.   Moreover, vendor shall typically assure a close cooperation with the steel supplier itself so as  to finally get the fine balance between the different specifications herein given.

Nevertheless, basic oxygen furnace process with heated ladle refining and vacuum  degassing may also be considered as acceptable,  All plates shall be thermally treated either by annealing, normalizing-and-tempering, or, when  permitted by the purchaser, accelerated cooling from the austenitizing temperature by air  blasting or liquid quenching, followed by tempering,  Heat treatments holding time shall be sufficient to obtain an uniform temperature throughout  the plate,  The tempering temperature shall be adapted so as to give the required mechanical  properties after post-weld heat treatment. It shall consequently be noted that, depending on  cases, the Minimum temperature of Tempering may sometimes be higher than the one  defined for the final Post-Weld Heat Treatment of the equipment.    2.1.2 Chemical analysis  Applications for which V-modified grade is specified will typically be operated at high  temperature (i.e. above 350°C). As a consequence, potential metallurgical embrittling  phenomena shall be properly anticipated during design and manufacturing phases.  Countermeasures including specific chemical analysis given here-below shall consequently  be considered and that whatever the values specified by the construction codes.

IN-MOD.dot / Rév. 5 du 19.03.2010  IN-42.3-5.1 Std material spec Low alloyed steels for pressure vessels.doc  In view of minimizing the risk of temper embrittlement, the \"J\" factor shall verify the relation  hereafter :    J lower than 100 (target 80)  with J = (Si + Mn) * (P + Sn) * 104      All elements mentioned here above, specified in weight percentages, have to be checked on  ladle and on product.     Notes:   - Susceptibility to Temper Embrittlement phenomenon has forced steel producers to restrict  tramp elements contents, mainly P, Sb, Sn, As (in order of decreasing severity in weight  percent basis) which elements can detrimentally diffuse to the grain boundaries while steel is  held within the embrittling temperature range.   This criterion and also the specified impurities level shall uniformly be guarantied for the  whole vessel, including the shell, heads and all other plates made pressure retaining parts as  well (e.g. nozzle parts, elbows, etc.).    2.1.3 Mechanical properties  2.1.3.1 Test specimens  As per code requirements SA20 / SA370 unless otherwise specified by the project  For wall thicknesses above or equal to 50mm, location of the Test specimens shall be in  accordance with section 5.5.1.1 of API 934,  The impact tests shall be carried out after heat treatments simulating those anticipated along  the fabrication that is post-forming heat treatment and intermediate HT, if any, and also final  PWHT  The Mechanical tests shall be carried out after heat treatments simulating those anticipated  along the fabrication that is post-forming heat treatment, intermediate HT, if any, and final  PWHT plus additional heat treatments to anticipate potential repair (number to be defined by  Contractor/Owner).  All tensile, impact, temper embrittlement and hardness testing on heat affected zones (HAZ)  shall be carried out on samples from production weld test plates.

IN-MOD.dot / Rév. 5 du 19.03.2010  IN-42.3-5.1 Std material spec Low alloyed steels for pressure vessels.doc  2.1.3.2 Tensile properties  Tensile tests shall be carried out at room temperature for both ends of each plate (Tensile  tests at design temperature may be requested for information, depending on the Contractor  specification).  Room temperature tensile properties shall meet the requirements of the material standard.  Yield strength at design temperature shall meet the value taken into account in calculation  notes (Ultimate Tensile Strength will be given for information).  Note: For Creep range calculation, Yield and Ultimate Strength may be given for information  at the Owner/EPC discretion.    2.1.3.3 Impact test properties  Charpy V-Notch impact testing is required for all pressure retaining components, welds and  heat affected zones (HAZ).  The average of three impact test values at testing temperature shall not be less than 55J  (40ft.lb) without individual value below 47J (35ft.lb).  Testing temperature shall be the lower of the Minimum Design Metal Temperature (MDMT)  and -18°C (0°F).  Note: One shall note that sulfur does act on resilience properties and sulfur content shall  consequently be kept as low as possible to obtain high CVN energy.    2.1.3.4 Step cooling treatment  Axens uses to consider that the step cooling treatment should only be mandatory for  equipments for which the operating temperature is above 350°C which should typically be  the case for the present steel grade. Final decision to be given by Contractor/Owner  In the aim at assessing the Temper Embrittlement detrimental effect on plates, forgings and  welding, transition curves (Impact energy versus Temperature) has to be plotted before and  after step cooling test. Test specimen status definition, and step cooling procedure as well,  have to be submitted to Contractor/Owner approval.  Unless otherwise specified by client or detail engineering, the Step Cooling Treatment shall  be carried out on the thickest plate issued from the Heat showing the highest J factor.  The said Treatment will also be carried out on the thickest Plates issued from Heats showing  J factor higher than 80 or P + Sn > 0.012%, if any.  Each qualified welding procedure shall also be submitted to Step cooling test. Transition  curves shall be obtained for the deposited Welding Metal and Heat Affected Zones as well.  Note: Vendor may propose, based on its own experience, to reduce the number of test  coupons by focusing onto the welding procedures which are considered as being the more  detrimental ones regarding the expected embrittlement. Final decision remains at  Contractor/Owner discretion       STANDARD MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS   Réf.  Rév.

IN-MOD.dot / Rév. 5 du 19.03.2010  IN-42.3-5.1 Std material spec Low alloyed steels for pressure vessels.doc  For information only, a typical step cooling sequence could be:  Heat to 595°C Hold for 1 hour, cool at 6°C/h max. to 540°C  Heat to 540°C Hold for 15 hours, cool at 6°C/h max. to 525°C  Heat to 525°C Hold for 24 hours, cool at 6°C/h max. to 495°C  Heat to 495°C Hold for 60 hours, cool at 3°C/h max. to 470°C  Heat to 470°C Hold for 100 hours, cool at 28°C/h max. at 315°C and then air cooling    This simulated isothermal embrittlement results in a certain increase (shift) of the material’s  transition temperature. The increase in transition temperature (TT55) from its original value  has become an accepted tool for the determination of temper embrittlement susceptibility. In  order to characterize a material for temper embrittlement resistance, a relationship was  developed using the original or “as fabricated” TT55 and the increase in TT55 (delta TT55).  After step cooling heat treatment, for impact properties (Charpy-V at ¼ T and ½ T material  thickness) should meet the following requirements:    TT55 + 2.5 delta TT55 lower than or equal to 10°C    Where TT55 is the 55 Joules transition temperature   and delta TT55 is (TT55 [step cooled] - TT55 [original value])    Note: Major steel vendors use to propose step-cooling treatment surrendering, for base  material, based on their know-how and demonstrated experiences provided that the specified  impact test energy criterion is verified at temperature of -60°C or below while measured J  factor is below 100. It is assumed that the available extra-clean steels shall allow obtaining  such high resilience and CVN-Energy levels.   Even if final decision remain at the Owner/Contractor discretion for base material, one shall  note that all Welding Qualification must undergo dedicated Step Cooling test (CVN impact  energy obtained from product coupons will have to be in accordance with the one obtained  during Qualification phase).     2.1.3.5 Hardness properties  The material hardness shall not exceed 235 HB.    2.1.3.6 Responsibility for Base material Tests  Mechanical tests may be performed by the base materials Manufacturer or the reactor  Manufacturer. The Mechanical Tests shall allow ensuring that the minimum mechanical  properties required will be met after all anticipated heat treatments of the reactor during and  after fabrication.

WELDING  3.1 General  The vessel Manufacturer shall not subcontract fabrication involving welding to others without  the written approval of the Contractor.  The plate, or forging edge preparation for welding as well as the nozzle openings will be  carried out by machining. Flame cutting may sometimes be allowed by the Contractor  provided the heat affected zone is completely removed by machining or grinding (ex: Nozzles  openings in shell or head).    3.2 Welding processes  - SAW : Submerged Arc Welding  The Manufacturer and brand name or grade of all welding consumables shall be  specified in the welding procedure and submitted to the Contractor for approval.  - SMAW : Shielded Manual Arc Welding  Only low hydrogen electrodes shall be used (refer to ASME II Part C SFA 5.5).

Notes:   - All the pressure retaining welds in hydrogen service , including the internals welded  on pressure parts, have to be full penetration type. If this is not possible, there will be a vent  drill-hole of the not welded area. External attachments are not concerned  - Only approved WPS with WPQR are to be used for fabrication. Welding procedures  submitted to the contractor shall include details variables and welding parameters for each  used welding process. Qualification test shall be made using filler metal, flux and / or inert  gases of same type, brand, chemistry and size as the ones to be used on work.  - Coupons to be used for Qualification test shall be heat treated in the same manner as  specified for the plate test as given in 2.1.3.

CLADDING OR WELD OVERLAY  4.1 Cladding  High-Alloy clad materials shall be in accordance with the ASME Section II, Part A,  Specification SA-264 for Chromium-Nickel Steels.  Cladding shall be 3mm minimum thickness SA-240 or as specified on the drawings. A  140Mpa minimum shear strength per SA-264 is required. The clad plate shall be  ultrasonically examined in accordance with SA-578 supplementary requirements S7 using  Level 1 acceptance criteria.    4.2 Weld Overlay  Generally speaking (when clad is specified as SS 321 or SS 347, or overlay is specified as   SS 347, on data sheet), the weld overlay is applied using a two-layers technique as follows:  - First layer : 309L SS  - Second layer : 347 SS (type 321SS shall not be permitted)  - Minimum effective thickness of undiluted alloy (after final machining if any) shall be those  required on equipment data sheet specification.  However, single layer weld deposit overlay (type 309LNb as typical) may be used provided  the fabricator can demonstrate to the contractor the use of a qualified and acceptable  procedure.  Note 1: When clad is specified as SS 317L or overlay is specified as SS 317L on data sheet,  the weld overlay is applied using a two-layers technique as follow:  - First layer:  309LMo SS or 309L SS  - Second layer:  317L  (Single layer not allowed)  Note 2: The number of weld layers in production shall not be less than the number of layers  deposited for weld overlay procedure qualification tests.  When required by the Owner/User, a method to evaluate the weld overlay for susceptibility to  hydrogen disbonding shall be agreed to between the Fabricator and Owner/User. In such  case, the Owner/User shall define testing requirements and acceptance criteria. An example  of a standard disbonding test may be found in ASTM G 146.  Welding processes are the same than in  paragraph 3-2,  using strips or wires for SAW  process.  GMAW process is not allowed, except for structural attachments welding on overlay.  FCAW with gas shielding may also be used for some limited location such as overlay on Cr- Mo joint, internal support rings, etc.  Both of GMAW and FCAW processes shall be authorized by the Contractor. As the same  manner, the use of Electroslag (ESW) process remains subject to Contractor’s acceptance.    STANDARD MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS   Réf.  Rév.

Ferrite content is typically determined by the as-deposited chemical composition and the  WRC-diagram.    4.4 Nozzles and Manways  Nozzles and Manways (neck, flange, blind) in clad vessels, or in clad section of vessels, shall  be of the same base material as the vessel and internally clad, or overlaid, with the same  high alloy.  Loose lining, lap-joint flanges, welding of nozzle of different material than the vessel is not  permitted.   The thickness of the cladding or overlay shall be at least equal to that of the cladding or  overlay of the vessel.      STANDARD MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS   Réf.  Rév.

POST WELD HEAT TREATMENT  The equipment shall receive PWHT as required by ASME and/or applicable code cases.  Final PWHT modifies the microstructure of the weld metal and of the Heat Affected Zones. It  gives the best metallurgical asset of the weldment.  Unless otherwise specified by steel maker a typical recommended range of temperature  could be 690-720°C – Holding time by reactor manufacturer according to wall thickness and  code and taking into account the anticipated number of heat treatment cycles.  Note: Vessel Manufacturer has the full responsibility of the mechanical behavior of the  vessel. For this reason, PWHT specification shall be optimized and defined by himself (in  accordance with steel Manufacturer) so as to guaranty, at one and the same time,  mechanical and toughness characteristics on the delivered equipment.   Given typical temperature range may accordingly be reconsidered so as to get the fine  balance between strength and toughness..  Intermediate Heat treatments definition is under vessel vendor scope and shall be approved  by Contractor,  - ISR (intermediate stress relieving) uses to reduce the hydrogen content in the welds  and reduces residual stresses in the welded joints as well. The temperature for ISR is  typically led in between 650°C-680°C while holding time will depend on thickness  (min. 2h). Different holding temperature may be accepted when vessel manufacturer  has good fabrication experience. To be approved by Contractor. It is the standard  practice to require ISR for restrained welds such as nozzle attachment welds and  main welds that will not be immediately postweld heat treated.  - DHT (Dehydrogenation Treatment) only uses to reduce the hydrogen content in the  welds to prevent from hydrogen induced cracking. This alternative lower temperature  HT should be addressed on a case-by-case basis considering the low as-welded  toughness of V-modified steels and the induced risks. DHT shall not be allowed  without getting prior approval of the Contractor. This heat treatment is performed at  around 350°C (min.4h) ) thus limiting the Cr carbide precipitation in stainless steel  weld overlay if any. However, if vessel manufacturer has previous experience with  lower temperature and holding time he may propose other conditions supported by  data.  All welding (including potential weld repairs) will be completed before final PWHT excepted  where special care has been taken to avoid necessity of PWHT (buttering with high alloy  deposits).  Note: Local PWHT shall not be permitted. In case of any furnace size limitation, vessel  Manufacturer shall obtain specific derogation from the Contractor to perform local PWHT at  the closing seam of shell.

NON DESTRUCTIVE TESTING BY FABRICATOR  For vessels designed and constructed in accordance with the rules of ASME Section VIII,  Div.1, Inspection Plan and Testing Plan shall be submitted to Engineering (EPC) for  approval.  For vessels designed and constructed in accordance with the rules of ASME Section VIII,  Div.2, non destructive examination (NDE) as a minimum shall comply with the Table AF- 241.1.    6.1 Minimum requirements  Minimum requirements for NDE should typically include the following non-destructive tests :  - Radiographic examination (RT) on all pressure welds (prior to PWHT only, provided  that UT is made before and after PWHT). RT is not so effective after PWHT for detecting  potential cracks. RT is sensitive for volumetric flaw such as slugs inclusion but not  sensitive for shape cracks which could appear during PWHT. Nevertheless, the final  decision, relative to RT examination sequences, belongs to the Contractor  - Use of the TOFD (Time Of Flight Diffraction) techniques in place of RT can be  proposed  by Vendor. Even if permitted by Code case, this shall be submitted to  Owner/Contractor approval  - Ultrasonic examination (UT) for all pressure welds (prior/after PWHT and after  hydrotest),  - Positive Material Identification (PMI) on all alloyed material if any (cladding, overlay,  etc.),  - Mill test report shall be supplied for all materials,  - Magnetic Particles Examination (MT) after PWHT,  - Dye penetrant examination (PT) of all weld overlay surfaces after PWHT.  Note: If Vendor can duly establish that weld-overlay has been performed continuously, thus  guarantying that no change in welding conditions has been encountered while depositing on  vessel shell, then PT could be performed on some representative w/o width lines only.  Procedure’s acceptance shall be submitted to Owner/Contractor decision. Whatever the  approved procedure will be, 100% complementary visual inspection always remains  mandatory.  - Hardness measurement.  - In case of cladding and/or overlay, Ferrite checking (magnetic ferriscope) in addition  to ferrite evaluation based upon sampling and chemical analysis.
